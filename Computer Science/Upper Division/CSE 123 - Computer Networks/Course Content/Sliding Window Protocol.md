- Can serve 3 different roles:
	- Reliably deliver frames across an unreliable link.
	- Preserve the order in which frames are transmitted.
	- Support flow control, a feedback mechanism by which the receiver is able to throttle the sender.
		- Keeps the sender from transmitting more data than the receiver is able to process.
- Remember to ask ourselves whether a mechanism is necessary at the current level before incorporating it into the current level's protocol.

- Each frame has a sequence number, **SeqNum**.
- Sender has 3 variables and maintains that **LFS - LAR <= SWS** (the frames we are working with fit in our window)
	- send window size, **SWS**
		- upper bound on # of unacknowledged frames that sender can transmit at once
		- compute by the **delay x bandwidth product**.
	- last acknowledgement received, **LAR**
		- the sequence number of the last acknowledgement received
		- i.e. we're done worrying about this frame
		- When ack arrives, LAR is moved to the right, allowing the SWS to "slide" to the right!
	- last frame sent, **LFS**
		- the sequence number of the last frame sent
		- haven't received an acknowledgement at this point in time, presumably
- Sender associates a timer with each frame it transmits and retransmits upon timeout.
	- So sender must keep up to SWS frames buffered in case the ack never comes and it must retransmit.


- Receiver has 3 variables and maintains that **LAF - LFR <= RWS**
	- receive window size, **RWS**
		- upper bound on *out of order* frames that the receiver is willing to accept
		- can set to whatever.
	- largest acceptable frame, **LAF**
		- the sequence number of largest acceptable frame number, i.e. the receiver will refuse frames with a sequence number larger than LAF
	- last frame received, **LFR**
		- the sequence number of the last frame received
		- i.e. we're done worrying about this frame
- Receiver also has to decide whether or not to send an ACK.
	- **SeqNumToAck** denotes the largest sequence number *not yet acknowledged*.
		- i.e. all frames with sequence numbers less than or equal to SeqNumToAck have been received.
		- So when all the frames w seq # <= SeqNumToAck arrive, we can finally acknowledge SeqNumToAck.
	- The ACK to be sent corresponds to SeqNumToAck, even if higher numbered packets have been received.
		- After sending that ACK, the receiver will set **LFR = SeqNumToAck** and adjusts **LAF = LFR + RWS**.
			- i.e. we can now accept a higher sequence number frame, since we have "slid" our window!
