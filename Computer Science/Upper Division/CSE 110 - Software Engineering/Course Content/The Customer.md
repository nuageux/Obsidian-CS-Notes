#Project
### Short History/Context
Quality control before was **Product-Centric**, the *what*. People would regularly test *product outputs* and make adjustments to the factory as necessary.

Now, we have shifted to a **Process-Centric** method, the *how*. We still test product outputs, but we also measure *process elements* (like plans, people, tools, etc.) and use a *cause-and-effect* model to adjust the factory as necessary.
- Using **Statistical Process Control**, we use statistics to precisely track variation.

# Key Project Concepts
Most projects have two major concerns; the **cost** and the **time** constraints, and are also concerned about the list of **requirements** and features.  ^0aa4e8
- So we want to deliver *quality* software that is *on time* and *on budget*.
- As it happens, there are always tradeoffs between features, schedule, and budget; we can't have them all! This concept is known as the **Iron Triangle**.
- *Software isn't complete* until it's been **released**!

We are the **developers** making the software.

**Customers** are the person or people paying to build the software (and are usually **not** the user!).

Everyone else are **Stakeholders**, everyone else directly or indirectly affected by the product.

The *Big Bang* method, where the software is produced all at once with only one initial meeting with the customer, usually produces a piece of software full of developer assumptions which is likely far off from what the customer wanted in the first place.
- Therefore, we talk to the customer often to clear up assumptions.

# Iteration
This is the secret to great software development. Any time significant progress is made, developers check with the customer to refine what is being worked on. A huge benefit of iteration is it allows us to adapt on the fly to changing conditions.
- Iterations always produce _working_, *quality* software.
- Think of iterations as "mini-projects".
- 20 (*working*) days is a good number for iteration length.
- The greater the risks, the shorter our iterations should be.

If at the end of an iteration the customer asks for changes, we renegotiate priorities, iterations, schedule, and budget with the customer.
