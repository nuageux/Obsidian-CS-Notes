Spring 2022
Instructors: Prof.s Sanjoy Dasgupta, Russell Impagliazzo

#### Course Description: 
"Design and analysis of efficient algorithms with emphasis on nonnumerical algorithms such as sorting, searching, pattern matching, and graph algorithms. Measuring complexity of algorithm time and storage. NP-complete problems."

### Overview
The overall problem structure in this class observes a problem statement then finds the obvious algorithm that solves the problem (oftentimes quite literally). The goal of this class is to then find a better algorithm!
- Obvious
	- Usually implicit in the problem statement
- Methodical
	- Applies general principles and paradigms that improve algorithms for a wide variety of problems
- Clever
	- Stretches the general paradigms in a way to best fit a particular problem
- Miraculous

The main philosophy is to **store and re-use** *instead of recomputing*.
