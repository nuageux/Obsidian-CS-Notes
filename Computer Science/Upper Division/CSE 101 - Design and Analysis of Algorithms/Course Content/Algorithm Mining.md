#Algorithm 

We can use the algorithms we already know to be correct to solve other related problems (although they may seemingly be unrelated)!

- **Deeper Analysis**: What else does the algorithm already give us?
- **Augmentation**: What additional info can we glean just by keeping track of the progress of the algorithm?
- **Modification**: How can we use the same idea to solve new problems in a similar way?
- **Reduction**: How can we use the algorithm as a black box to solve new problems?
