- how systems behave in the presence of an adversary, an intelligence that actively tries to cause a system to misbehave
- security and safety are different. safety is without the presence of an adversary.

### Common approach
- cycle of attack and defense

anatomy of an attack
- ex: weakness (lv2), a factor that predisposes a system to vulnerability
- vulnerability
- assault
- a set of steps taken to take advantage of one of the above

- learn about new classes of threats
- determine what to defend against
- help devs create stronger systems
- help users more accurately evaluate risk
