#Practical #Computer-Architecture 
# Pipelining
- We will look at a high-level model of instruction execution with **six stages**:
	- Fetch, Decode, Read, Execute, Write, (compute) Next instruction (**FDREWN**).
- The CPU has a "program counter" (PC) that holds the address of the current instruction.
	- The CPU then executes the instruction at the PC, then either
		- increments the PC to the point of the next instruction
		- OR (for a branch or jump) sets the PC to a new value
