subtree of futures changes over time
- dont use algorithms that search randomly in this vast random space, find a good path
- find out the information we want

Initial states and goal states, and there are action states that bring us from old to new states
- "generate futures"
- state space is all the places we can be at and is by nature very high dimensional
- defining costs and rewards
- so search problems are finding a sequence of actions that minimize costs and maximizes reward

DFS BFS review
- frontier working set
- path to goal state is important
- avoid cycles within graphs
- dfs is complete in finite spaces but not in infinite graphs.
- bfs is, however
