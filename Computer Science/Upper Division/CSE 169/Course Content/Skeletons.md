## Matrix Algebra Review
- 3d models
	- has an array of position vectors describing its shape
	- each vector in the n-array has 3 components x y and z
- to move the model, we call it a translation
	- compute a new array of positions representing the new location
	- if d represents an offset, we simply add that vector d to our position array
- a translation is a simple example of a transformation
- remember that this is effectively a loop over the bunch of n vertices
- can be written as vertical vectors or a system of equations
- rotation by angle theta

	- rotation matrix times the 3-d vector
	- other rotations defined in slides
	- arbitrary axis rotation included
