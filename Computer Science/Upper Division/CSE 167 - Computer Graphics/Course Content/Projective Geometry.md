## What are Projective Transforms?
### Perspective
- Orthographic View
- Perspective View
	- Foreshortening
### Goal
### (Viewing) Frustum
- Parameters are:
	- Field of View
	- Aspect Ratio
	- Near Clipping Distance
	- Far Clipping Distance
### Collineation
- a.k.a. Projective Transformation, Homography
- Parallelism is usually not preserved!
### Linear, Affine, and Projective
- The difference with projective is the matrix multiplication is by a general 4x4 matrix.

### Final Projection after ModelView

### Projection Matrix

## How Homogeneous Coordinates Work
### Homogeneous Coordinates
- "Proportions"
### Between 3D and 4D homo. coord.
- homogenize, 4D linear transformation, then dehomogenize
#### Example
