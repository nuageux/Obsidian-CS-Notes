#### Course Description:  
"Important ideas and algorithms in search & reasoning and how they are used in practical AI applications, including A* search, adversarial search, Monte Carlo tree search, reinforcement learning, constraint solving and optimization, and propositional and first-order reasoning."

**Algorithmic approaches for making intelligent decisions.**

## Course Content
- Classical Search
	- Search problems are defined by initial states and goal states alongside action states that bring us from old to new states.
	- The "state space" is all the states it is possible to be at and is by nature very high dimensional.
	- We must also define costs and rewards for search problems if we wish to find a sequence of actions that minimize costs and maximizes reward.
	- The most common algorithms to search are
		- [[DFS and BFS]]
		- [[Dijkstra's Algorithm#^3864c1|Uniform Cost Search]]
		- [[A Star||A*]]
- [[Adversarial Search]]
- [[Markov Decision Processes]]
- [[Reinforcement Learning]]
- [[Monte Carlo Tree Search]]
- [[Constraint Solving]]
- [[Propositional Logic|Propositional Reasoning]]
- SAT Solving
- First-order Reasoning
