#Course #CSE #CPP
Prerequisites: [[CSE 12 - Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design]], [[CSE 15L - Software Tools and Techniques]], [[CSE 21 - Mathematics for Algorithms and Systems]], [[CSE 30 - Computer Organization & Systems Programming]]

Winter 2022
Instructor: Prof. Niema Moshiri

#### Course Description: 
"High-performance [[Data Structures vs. Abstract Data Types#^7728a3|data structures]] and supporting algorithms. Use and implementation of data structures like (un)balanced [[Trees|trees]], [[Graphs and Graph Traversal#^4382bb|graphs]], [[Priority Queues|priority queues]], and [[Hashing, Hash Tables, Hash Maps, and Collisions|hash tables]]. Also, [[Memory Management|memory management]], [[C++ Review#^ba343a|pointers]], [[Recursion|recursion]]. Theoretical and practical [[Time and Space Complexity|performance analysis]], both average case and amortized. Uses [[C++ Review|C++]] and its Standard Template Library."

##### Course Goals:
To be able to:
- **Analyze** data structures for both *time* and *space* complexity.
- **Describe** the *strengths* and *weaknesses* of a data structure.
- **Implement** complex data structures correctly and efficiently.
