Winter 2022
Instructor: Prof. Shachar Lovett

#### Course Description: 
"An introduction to the mathematical theory of computability. Formal Languages. Finite automata and regular expressions. Push-down automata and context-free languages. Computable or recursive functions including Turing machines and the halting problem. Undecidability."

##### Big Questions:
- What problems are computers capable of solving?
- What resources are needed to solve a problem?
- Are some problems harder than others?

## Course Content
**Regular Languages**
[[Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)]]
[[Regular Expressions]]
[[Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)]]
[[Pumping Lemma]]

**Context-Free Languages**
[[Context Free Grammar]]
[[Push Down Automata]]

**Turing Machines and Languages**
[[Turing Machines]]
[[Decidability]]
[[Undecidability]]

**Key Takeaway**
All regular languages are also context-free;
all context-free languages are decidable;
all decidable languages are Turing-recognizable;
yet this transitive relationship is not necessarily true in the opposite direction.
