### Mutually Exclusive

^5838e6
    - Independent means the outcome of one event does not affect the probability of the other event whatsoever.
    - Mutually exclusive means that if one outcome happens, the other one cannot possibly happen (and vice-versa).
        - This means that mutually exclusive events are _dependent_ events!
