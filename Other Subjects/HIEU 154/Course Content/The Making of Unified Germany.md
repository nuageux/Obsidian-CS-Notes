### Central Europe at the Time of the French Revolution
- Germany didn't exist! Was the "Holy Roman Empire" of the German nation.
	- Very loose structure.
	- The most important aspect of being a nation?
		- John Gottfried Herder's concept of the "cultural nation", where Germans would feel united by a shared culture
			- Like Grimm's fairy tails, cuisine, *language*
			- A *shared story*
		- Modern theories of nationalism include:
			- primordialist (outdated), where nations were "already there" and were simply awakened
			- constructivist view, where nations need to be made and are artificial
				- by invention of tradition
				- and by imagined communities

### Impact of the French Revolution
- "In the beginning was Napoleon..." because Napoleon destroyed the Holy Roman Empire, and got some German states to side with him in the Formation of the Rhine!
	- Many wanted to follow the example of the French, who made changes not through revolution, but through reform.
- German nationalism surged against France in the "wars of liberation" (1813-15)
	- Why is it anti-french? The intellectuals led this mode of thought. 
		- Ernst Moritz Arndt wrote a very anti-french song.
	- Careful to consider that most of the poor really didn't care! All war is pretty bad.
- 19th Century Liberalism, which back then was directed *against* the state.
	- Wanted constitutional government, civil rights, free rights, free speech, free trade, property rights

### Restoration of Europe (1815-48)
Europe was re-organized at the Vienna Conference, which rejected the ideals of liberalism and nationalism, turning the values of Europe upside down to restore the old order of monarchy.
- There was a persistence of liberalism and nationalism in the face of this, however.
	- Esp in student fraternities, where often they walked up to castles and partied there (lol).
	- Hambach Celebration
- Economic vs. Political Unification with the German Customs Union, with the hope that economic union would lead to political union.
- 1848, the revolution that failed(?) all across Europe (starting in Paris), driven, of course, by liberalism and nationalism.
	- Initially successful!
	- The German Constitution was written in this context (by the "Conference of Professors"), written in favor of a constitutional monarchy and offered the Prussian King the crown of Germany.
		- The King turned it down, quite rudely at that. Prussian military was mobilized to suppress Germany.
	- Some historians claim that if this revolution succeeded, Germany could have avoided all of its problems. Kind of a weird assumption?

### Constitutional Government in Prussia
- The Prussian king realized he couldn't suppress the ideals of nationalism and liberalism, and conceded to the Germans.
	- But, he controlled who was elected to the government carefully
		- One method of which was the "Three Class Voting Right", where the upper class (who paid more taxes) had votes weighted heavily in their favor. This was kept in Prussia until 1918!
- Bismarck and the Constitutional Conflict
	- The King could not anticipate the consequences... Some wealthy began to convert their philosophies!
		- Due to the period of industrialization, leading to businessmen and bankers who wanted the economic freedom.
	- Led to the parliament refusing to approve extension of military service (the budget), leading to a stalemate.
	- Otto von Bismarck called in, a staunch supporter of the Prussian Monarchy.
		- Argues there is a constitutional gap that lets the king spend the money anyways. Liberals not so happy about this.

### Making Germany
- Bismarck's famous "iron and blood" quotation.
- Three wars in 1864-71, engineered by Bismarck:
	- Prussia + Austria vs Denmark
	- German Civil War: Prussia vs Austria
	- French-German War
		- France would not tolerate a unified Germany, so Bismarck baited France into war.
- Prussia had a more modern army.
- A controversial figure, his actions split the liberals into those who supported him and those who didn't.
- The nature of the German Empire
	- Versailles Palace was where the Germans as a middle finger officially created their nation.
	- They were dressed in uniform!
- Bismarck allowed universal male suffrage because it really didn't matter; the parliament had basically no power.
- Prussian state had 17 votes, but only 14 votes needed to prevent a change to the Constitution.

## The German Constitution
- Germany was surprisingly liberal, and had universal male suffrage, had basic rights, constitutional govt and separation of powers, reasonably free press...
	- ...but the political culture and belief in democracy was lacking.
- the military was very protected in the constitution
	- ensured that the miltary budget would only be negotiated every 5 years, reducing Reichstach power.
- Bebel really hated the constitution, calling it reactionary.
- von Sybel saw the problems with the government and the German nation for liberalism, but saw hope if the emperor would cooperate.
- The geopolitics with threats all around them left them in a unique situation.

## Making Germans: Bismarck's Policies of Division and Reform
- "Germanization", which was the oppression of and expulsion of ethnic minorities (esp. Polish)
	- Encouraged Germans to move to the German territories
- The next minority to target was Catholics, because their loyalty to the Pope in Rome and not the German state.
	- Priests were pretty acutely targeted
	- Bismarck had a strong political ally amongst the liberals.
		- Because the liberals saw the Church as old fashioned, feminine, and not a part of the German future. Very superstitious!
- The biggest threat of all, however, were the socialists.
	- They are also *internationalists*! Loyalties lie *outside of Germany*!
	- Anti-Socialist Law 1878-90
	- Bismarck switched his allegiance to the conservatives when liberals showed hesitation on the socialist issue.
		- Called the refounding of the Reich in 1878, because the liberal hopes for reform were annihilated.

## Social Reform
- Bismarck introduced the welfare state to Germany!
	- Health insurance law 83
	- Accident insurance law 84
	- Old Age and Invalid insurance law (Social Security) 1889
- Weber's opinion on "Charismatic Rule", after legal rule and beaurocratic rule
