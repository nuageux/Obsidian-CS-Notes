#History #German
# The Making of United Germany
## Central Europe during the French Revolution
- Germany didn't exist! Was the "Holy Roman Empire" of the German nation.
	- Very loose structure.
## What is a Nation?
- John Gottfried Herder's concept of the "cultural nation", where Germans would feel united by a shared culture
	- Like Grimm's fairy tales, cuisine, *language*
	- A *shared story*
- Modern theories of nationalism include:
	- primordialist (outdated), where nations were "already there" and were simply awakened
	- constructivist view, where nations need to be made and are artificial
		- by invention of tradition
		- and by imagined communities
## Impact of the French Revolution
- "In the beginning was Napoleon..." because Napoleon destroyed the Holy Roman Empire, and got some German states to side with him in the Formation of the Rhine
	- Many wanted to follow the example of the French, who made changes not through revolution, but through reform.
- German nationalism surged against France in the "wars of liberation" (1813-15)
	- Why is it anti-French? The intellectuals led this mode of thought. 
		- Ernst Moritz Arndt wrote a very anti-French song.
	- Most of the poor really didn't care! All war is pretty bad for the poor.
- 19th Century Liberalism, which back then was directed *against* the state.
	- Wanted constitutional government, civil rights, free press, free speech, free trade, property rights

## Restoration of Europe and the Revolutions of 1848
- Europe was re-organized at the Vienna Conference, which rejected the ideals of liberalism and nationalism, turning the values of Europe upside down to restore the old order of monarchy.
	- There was a persistence of liberalism and nationalism in the face of this in Germany.
		- Esp in student fraternities, where often they walked up to castles and partied there (lol).
		- e.g. the Hambach Celebration
- Economic vs. Political Unification with the German Customs Union, with the hope that economic union would lead to political union.
- 1848, the revolution that failed(?) all across Europe (starting in Paris), driven, of course, by liberalism and nationalism.
	- Initially successful!
	- The German Constitution was written in this context (by the "Conference of Professors"), written in favor of a constitutional monarchy and offered the Prussian King the crown of Germany.
		- The King turned it down, quite rudely at that. Prussian military was mobilized to suppress Germany.
	- Some historians claim that if this revolution succeeded, Germany could have avoided all of its problems. Kind of a weird assumption?

## Constitutional Government in Prussia
- The Prussian king realized he couldn't suppress the ideals of nationalism and liberalism, and conceded to the Germans.
	- But, he controlled who was elected to the government carefully
		- One method was the "Three Class Voting Right", where the upper class (who paid more taxes) had votes weighted heavily in their favor. This was kept in Prussia until 1918.
- Bismarck and the Constitutional Conflict
	- The King could not anticipate the consequences... Some wealthy landowners began to convert their philosophies!
		- Due to the period of industrialization, leading to businessmen and bankers wanting economic freedom.
	- Led to the parliament refusing to approve extension of military service (the budget), leading to a stalemate.
	- Otto von Bismarck called in, a staunch supporter of the Prussian monarchy.
		- Argues there is a constitutional gap that lets the king spend the money anyways. Liberals not so happy about this.

## Making Germany: Unification and Nature of the German Empire
- Bismarck's famous "iron and blood" speech.
- Three wars in 1864-71, engineered by Bismarck to unify Germany:
	- Prussia + Austria vs Denmark
	- German Civil War: Prussia vs Austria
	- French-German War
		- France would not tolerate a unified Germany, so Bismarck baited France into war.
- Prussia had a more modern army.
- A controversial figure, Bismarck's actions split the liberals into those who supported him and those who didn't.
- Bismarck allowed universal male suffrage because it really didn't matter; the parliament had basically no power.
	- Meant that technically, Germany was a democratic nation.

### The German Constitution
- Germany was surprisingly liberal, and had universal male suffrage, had basic rights, constitutional gov't and separation of powers, reasonably free press...
	- ...but the political culture and belief in democracy was lacking.
- The military was very protected in the constitution.
	- Was ensured that the miltary budget would only be negotiated every 5 years, reducing the Reichstach's power.
- Prussian state had 17 votes, and only 14 votes needed to prevent a change to the Constitution. Monarchy never really lost control.
- Bebel really hated the constitution, calling it reactionary.
- von Sybel saw the problems with the government and the German nation for liberalism, but saw hope if the emperor would cooperate.

## Making Germans: Bismarck's Policies of Division and Reform
- "Germanization", which was the oppression of and expulsion of ethnic minorities (esp. Polish)
	- Encouraged Germans to move to the German territories
- The next minority to target was Catholics, because their loyalty to the Pope in Rome and not the German state.
	- Priests were targeted
	- Bismarck had a strong political ally amongst the liberals.
		- The liberals saw the Church as old fashioned, feminine, and not a part of the German future. Very superstitious!
- The biggest threat of all, however, were the socialists.
	- They are also *internationalists*! Loyalties lie *outside of Germany*.
	- See the Anti-Socialist Law, 1878-90.
	- Bismarck switched his allegiance to the conservatives when liberals showed hesitation on the socialist issue.
		- Called the "refounding of the Reich" in 1878, alluding to how the liberal hopes for reform were annihilated.
- Social Reform
	- Bismarck introduced the welfare state to Germany!
		- Health insurance law 83
		- Accident insurance law 84
		- Old Age and Invalid insurance law (Social Security) 1889
- Weber's opinion on "charismatic rule" (which came after legal rule and beaurocratic rule).
