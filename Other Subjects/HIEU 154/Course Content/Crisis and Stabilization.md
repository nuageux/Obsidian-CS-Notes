#German #History
## Political Challenges from Left and Right
- Kapp Putsch in 1920, the attempted Right coup
	- Defeated by general strike, but the army that Ebert cut a deal with refused to suppress the *Right* revolt, declaring that "army does not shoot on army".
- The Left pulls up with the "Red Army of the Ruhr"
- Political Murder
	- The Right usually got away with a slap on the wrist... So they murdered a ton more than the Left.
	- A recognition that the problem was right-wing terrorism was necessary to save the nation.
- Possibly another crossroads point. If Ebert didn't make these ill-fated compromises, would Germany have came out alright?
- The Denial of Defeat:
	- Weimar's "Big Lie" that they had not "lost" WWI... they were "stabbed in the back" by Jews and Socialists! Suuure.

## International Problems
- Versailles Treaty
	- Demilitarization, very harshly limits the army to 100,000
	- Territorial Losses
	- The "War Guilt" clause, humiliating Germany
	- Reparations, without the price given upfront (it's gonna be huge)

## Economic Problems: Inflation
- Originated from the wartime financing...
- ...but exacerbated by the postwar situation.
- Inflation facilitated the clear transition from a war to postwar state.
- External Circumstances: French Occupation of the Ruhr, b/c the French thought the Germans were being slow on their payments on purpose.
	- Led to German peaceful protest, refusal to work on occupied land.
	- Government financially backed them, since they wouldn't be paid during that time. A bit of a fool, prideful move from Germany.
- Hyperinflation changes the perception of being frugal or being a big spender: it was now better to spend your money right away, and those who saved money lost *everything*.
	- People with high debts, fixed assets, and producers benefited.

## Crisis Year, 1923
- Hitler-Putsch, 1923
	- Another coup that failed miserably
- Why didn't the republic collapse right then and there?
	- The gov't resorted to a clause in the constitution to stabilize the republic under Gustav Stresemann, a "republican of reason".

## Stabilization and Ticking Time Bombs
- Government resorts to emergency powers and defends republic against national and territorial disintegration.
- Ended policy of passive resistance, enacted currency reform
- US intervention and reparation settlement (Dawes Plan)
- Private US loans to Germany
- Reconciliation with France with the Treaty of Locarno (1925)
- Stability is reflected in the elections, where the Weimar coalition almost gets the majority in 1924
- Problems still exist, though:
	- structural unemployment and agrarian crisis
	- industry resents contribution to welfare state
	- selection between worthy and unworthy recipients of aid, introduction of racist and eugenic principles
	- was no eastern "Locarno", so no acceptance of borders on the east with Poland and Russia
	- death of Ebert, election of von Hindenberg as Reichspresident in 1925... a Monarchist
	- military, civil service, and industrial elites constantly pushing for anti-republicanism
