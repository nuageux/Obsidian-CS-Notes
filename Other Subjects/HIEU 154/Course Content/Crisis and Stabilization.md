## Political Challenges from Left and Right
- Kapp Putsch in 1920, the attempted Right coup
	- Defeated by general strike
- The Left pulls up with the "Red Army of the Ruhr"
- Political Murder
	- And the Right usually got away with a slap on the wrist... So they murdered a shitton more than the Left.
	- A recognition that the problem was right-wing terrorism
- Possibly another crossroads point. If Ebert didn't make these ill-fated compromises, would Germany not have done the shitshow that it had done?
## The Denial of Defeat
- Weimar's "Big Lie" that they had not "lost" WWI... they were "stabbed in the back" by Jews and Socialists!!! omg!!!
## International Problems
- Versailles Treaty...
- Demilitarization, very harshly
- Territorial Losses
- War Guilt Loss
- Reparations w a blank check
## Economic Problems
- The Inflation
- Originated wartime financing
- but exacerbated by the postwar situation
- External cicrucmstance... French Occupation of the Ruhr, cuz the french thought the Germans were being slow on their payments on purpose.
	- Led to German peaceful protest, refusal to work on occupied land
	- Government financially backed them.
- Changes the perception of being frugal or being a big spender
- People with savings are fucked
## Crisis Year in 1923
- Hitler-Putsch
	- failed miserably
- Why didn't the rupublic collapse right then and there?
	- The govt resorted to a clause in the constitution to stabilize the republic under Gustav Stresemann
## Relative Stability
- ended policy of passive resistance, currency reform
- us intervnetion and reparation settlement (Dawes)
- private US loans to Germany
- reconciliation with France, treaty of locarno
- stability is reflected in elections, weimar colation almost gets the majority, too 1924
- problems exist, though
	- structural unemployment and agrarian crisis
	- industry resents contribution to welfare state
	- selection between worthy and unworthy recipients of aid, introduction of racist and eugenic principles
	- was no eastern "locarno", so no acceptance of borders on the east with poland and russia lol
	- death of ebert, election of von hindenberg as reichspresident in 1925... a monarchist
	- elites, civil service. and industrial elites constantly poushing antirepublicanism
