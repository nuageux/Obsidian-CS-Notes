## Prologue: The Modernity of Imperial Germany
- In the monotony of industrial life, modern Germans looked for expressions of individualism, such as nudism or vegetarianism.
#### Art
- German leaders had a clear idea of what art should be like.
	- The Kaiser thought that art should contribute to the "education" of the people.
	- See portraits and paintings of important figures and high society, of rural moral values and the beauty of German nature.
- The Kaiser did *not* like modernist artists.

## Modernism
- Modernism states that art should inspire thoughts and feelings.
	- Moving away from an external representation of the external world, a break with tradition that had existed since the Rennaisance depictions of an objective, knowable reality.
	- More emphasis on the subjective perspective of the painter.
- **Impressionism**
	- New arrangements of light and color, turning away from realism.
	- A philosophy that reality always changes; think of how light constantly changes how we see a portion of "reality".
	- Consummate the concept of "inspiration".
- **Expressionism**
	- Non-representational, doesn't reproduce reality.
	- An autonomous, subjective reality.
	- Captures not what's real, but what the artist sees as real.
	- Communicate feelings through art. The viewer should engage in an emotional and intellectual relationship with the picture.
- Fascination with Primitivism
	- ...with places where modernity had not yet arrived... where the development of the world hadn't been "tainted" by culture yet.
	- It was an inherently racist view. e.g. Nazi artists thought it was desirable, thinking it was better to have everything taken care of by the Germans if a society was of an "inferior" race.
- Then, the move towards complete abstraction:
	- Where there is no longer a message, the alienation of the artist from the world.
	- There is no longer any message in the art.
	- No universal standards exist for what constitutes "abstract" art.
	- Interestingly, the abstract and confusing message was "interpreted" to produce consensus in German society.
		- The message that modernist art is degenerate, Jewish, for outcasts, crazy, and not a part of Germany.
		- Led to the common tactic of German leadership to define what constituted as "normal".

## Antisemitism in Imperial Germany
- Jewish were a very small minority in Germany, 1%.
- They also had full legal equality, listed in the Constitution with all citizen rights.
- Antisemitism paradoxically increased with Jewish emancipation and equality.
- Note the difference between religious and ethnic antisemitism.
- There were antisemites everywhere. "The Jews are our misfortune"
- Anti-Semitic Parties
- Was difficult for the Jewish to enter positions in civil service and the military, a social antisemitism.
- Many Jewish believed in the possibility of synthesizing their culture with the Germans.

## German Women
- Legal Position
	- No legal equality, subordinated to husband, no political parties, no choice of profession
		- Many women worked as teachers before becoming married.
- Marriage and Sexuality
	- man chooses wife
	- wife's identity defined through her husband
	- divorce possible but difficult
	- virginity is important
	- a lot of out of wedlock births in college towns
- Feminism
	- League for Sexual Reform (including prostitution, suffrage, etc)
- The Duel
	- an honor thing
		- the masculine question of whether one can control one's emotions in the face of death (as opposed to how women "show emotion freely")
	- male superiority, as female Germans could not do this, of course
