#German #History
## Nazi Ideology
- The core concept is replacing the liberal belief in individual rights with emphasis on the collective *Volk*.
- The adoption of Social Darwinism and theories of scientific racism.
- Anti-Semitism and association of Jewish with Democracy, Internationalism, Socialism.
- Anti-Bolshevism and "living space" in the East.
- Creation of  *Volksgemeinschaft* to overcome disunity and fragmentation.

## Nazi History
- The "leader principle", setting Hitler firmly in the leader's seat.
- Creation of a party infrastructure.
- Pledging legality, destroying democracy with democratic means.
- Creating the SA as a paramilitary formation: the "double bind" of law and order.

## Nazi Appeal
- The Germans are still mad about the Versailles treaty (understandably).
- Nazis denounce the "November criminals".
- A strong appeal to front sociers and the "war youth" generation.
- Appeals to rural workers and farmers.
- Unifying peasants, workers, and intellectuals.
- Anti-Communism and private property was advocated.
- Of course, anti-Semitism.
- Strategy of humanizing the FÃ¼hrer.
- Carefully choreographed mass rallies.
	- People even paid to see Hitler speak.
	- Hitler travelled in airplanes, the newest technology in order to speak all across Germany.
- Selective use of SA violence.
- Use of modern means of mass communication.
- **So the secret to Nazi success was their strategy to draw support from all sections of the population.**
	- The Protestant middle class was overrepresented while the industrial working class and Catholic groups were underrepresented.
	- Collected former non-voters and first time voters as well.

## From Papen to Hitler... Not a "Seizure" of Power
- There is still a political party stalemate in elections.
	- Notably, the Nazi party and the Communist party sum up to 50%, both supposed "enemies" of the German state.
- The Nazi victory was not a foregone conclusion... they were actually beginning to lose ground in 1933.
- But Papen had an idiotic idea to "tame" Hitler, believing that he could make Hitler a puppet so long as he surrounded him with old conservative officials.
	- Note that fascism has never came to power without the help of the old conservative elite.
	- So, the government was basically just given to Hitler.
