## Political Challenges from Left and Right
- Kapp Putsch in 1920, the attempted Right coup
	- Defeated by general strike
- The Left pulls up with the "Red Army of the Ruhr"
- Political Murder
	- And the Right usually got away with a slap on the wrist... So they murdered a shitton more than the Left.
	- A recognition that the problem was right-wing terrorism
- Possibly another crossroads point. If Ebert didn't make these ill-fated compromises, would Germany not have done the shitshow that it had done?
## The Denial of Defeat
- Weimar's "Big Lie" that they had not "lost" WWI... they were "stabbed in the back" by Jews and Socialists!!! omg!!!
## International Problems
- Versailles Treaty...
- Demilitarization, very harshly
- Territorial Losses
- War Guilt Loss
- Reparations w a blank check
## Economic Problems
