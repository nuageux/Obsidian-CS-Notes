#German #History
## The Great Depression
- Most serious crisis of capitalism, ever (until maybe 2008)
- Domestic reasons:
	- Speculation, overproduction (think Ford), lack of domestic demand in the US
- International reasons:
	- Flaws in the international monetary system:
		- American banks got nervous, gave up on chicken in the money circlejerk and called back their loans, collapsing everything
- Unemployment in Germnay was pretty high for a while.
	- Young men: basically half of them were out of work.
- Led to a massive decline in agricultural prices, industrial production, employment, and international trade.
- Suicide rate is high.

## Political Consequences
- The Crisis of the Republic...
- Fall of the SPD led gov't in March 1930 led to Heinrich Br端ning's poor economic policies of deflation:
	- Cutting state expenditure
	- Cutting welfare benefits
	- Raising taxes
- John Maynard Keynes is the opposing philosophy... "priming the pump" and "deficit spending".
	- Woytinsky, Tarnow, and Baade (WTB) presented a proposal suggesting exactly that philosophy, so it wasn't like Germany had no options.
- This, more or less, allows the Nazis to make a breakthrough.
- Br端ning's use of Article 48 to force deflationary policies means he can't oust the SPD just yet (though he would really like to).
	- He'd also like to shake off the shackles of the repayments.
	- Br端ning can only rule thanks to Hindenburg, and Hindenburg gets frustrated by Br端ning's reliance on the SPD.
- This split led to the Nazi party's highest share of the vote in any German election in 1932.

## Political Culture and the Messages of Political Parties
- Process of political mobilization: very high turnouts, young voters, women
- Significance of posters, spoken word
- How do political parties appeal to to voters?
