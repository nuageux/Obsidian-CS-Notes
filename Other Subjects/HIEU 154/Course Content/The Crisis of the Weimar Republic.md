## The Great Depression
- Most serious crisis of capitalism, ever (until maybe 2008)
- Domestic
	- Speculation, overproduction (think Ford), lack of domestic demand in the US
- International
	- flaws in the international monetary system
		- American banks got nervous, gave up on chicken in the money circlejerk and called back their loans, collapsing everything
- Unemployment in Germnay was p high for a while
	- Young men, like half of them were out of work

## Political Consequences
- Crisis of the Republic
- Fall of SPD led govt in March 1930, Heinrich Bruning's shit economic policies of deflation
	- cutting state expenditure
	- cutting welfare benefits
	- raising taxes
- John Maynard Keynes is the opposing philosophy... "priming the pump" and "deficit spending"
	- Woytinsky Tarnow Baade WTB presented a proposal (a trade union) suggesting exactly that...
- More or less allows the Nazis to make a breakthrough
- Bruning's use of Article 48 to force deflationary parties, means he can't oust SPD just yet (though he would really like to)
	- He'd also like to shake off the shackles of the repayments
	- Bruning can only rule thanks to Hindenburg, and Hindenburg gets frustrated by Bruning's reliance on the SPD
- This split led to the Nazi party's highest share of the vote in any German election

## Political Culture and the Messages of Political Parties
- process of political mobilization: very high turnouts, young voters, women
- significance of posters, spoken word
- How do political parties appeal to to voters?
- what were their messages?
