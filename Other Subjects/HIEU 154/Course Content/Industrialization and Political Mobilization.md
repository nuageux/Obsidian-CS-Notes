## Industrialization and Urbanization
- The growth of cities was unprecedentedly rapid.

## The Emergence of a Political Mass-Market
- Voter turnout increased drastically.
	- 1871 to 1912, 51% to 85% turnout
	- The transportation and communication revolution made politics much easier.
- Politics became more important b/c it became more important to people's lives.
	- Led to the expansion of state; people had to be involved to have a say in their daily lives.
	- Politics also became more fashionable in general.
- Socialism and Nationalism blew up as a consequence.

## Mobilization of the Left: The Rise of the SPD
- The Social Democratic Party enjoyed its meteoric rise alongside the voter turnout statistics.
- Socialism was mainly defined as the abolition of private property (and arguably holds the same definition today).
- Working class life in Germany was miserable.
#### Marxism
- The SPD's political ideology.
	- History portrayed as a history of class struggle.
		- The initial triumph of the bourgeoisie...
			- ...leading to its inevitable decline.
		- The immiseration of the proletariat...
			- ...leading to the Socialist revolution.
- Had an almost religious appeal to the working class of Germany.
- The psychological effects were myriad:
	- The image of liberating the worker from his chains was common.
	- So was the idea of a literal "march" to Socialism.
	- The 8-hour day was an issue won that motivated German workers.
- There were challenges to the SPD's orthodoxy, of course:
	- Kautsky said that "the SPD is a revolutionary but not a revolution-making party".
- Compare the revisionist Bernstein's analysis compared to the revolutionary Luxemburg's response.
- Workers' Associations for activities such as singing, hiking, gymnastics, and more arose.

## Mobilization on the Right: Nationalist Associations
- Not in classical parties, but in informal club-like "parties".
	- Some say they were used as tools by nationalist parties.
	- Others say they were not just controlled by elites, claiming that the parties were autonomous and radical.
		- They were indeed problems for conservatives at times.
	- e.g. the Pan-German League, the Navy League
- See Class's statement on nationalism, where he expresses
	- the need for expansion
	- anti-semitism
	- anti-democratic sentiment
	- anti-Socialist sentiment

**What this all summed up to was a deadlocked political system.**
