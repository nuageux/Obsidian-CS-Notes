#German #History
- A lot of music and art was banned because of some Jewish contribution to the piece(s).
- We use the "Germany Reports" of the SPD in Exile and the Secret Service of the SS's reports to research popular opinion in Nazi Germany.
	- Consider what biases are in play if one were to look for consent or dissent (look for SS for dissent).
- Social mobility through meritocracy was introduced in Nazi Germany (within the Nazi system, of course).
## The Politics of Culture
- The formation of the "Reichs Cultural Chamber", where you must be a member to be allowed to make any kind of art in Germany.
	- One of the core requirements is proof of no Jewish ancestry.
- Accommodation cases...
	- Richard Strauss, a prominent composer, appointed the President of the Reich Music Chamber.
		- Had a Jewish daughter-in-law and continued to work with Jewish artists.
		- Also tried to accommodate himself to the regime.
		- The idea was to have a famous artist as the president to establish legitimacy, but he was dismissed for the reasons above anyways.
	- Emil Nolde, a famous expressionist painter. 
		- Was also part of the Nazi party!
		- Was featured in the "Degenerate Art" gallery and was banned from painting.

## Degenerate Art
- The House of German Art vs the exhibit on "Degenerate Art"
	- There were 9 categories.
- Hitler's ideals dictate the perfection of the human form, not its interpretation in any other way.
