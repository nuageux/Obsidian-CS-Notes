#German #History
## The Origins of WWI
- Began with an act of terrorism in Sarajevo, Austria.
	- A Bosnian assassin with ties with the Serbian gov't.
- How did it all blow up? Local incidents commonly grow out of proportion throughout history...
	- Germany's *carte blanche* to Austria to retaliate as they liked.
	- Russia in response mobilizes its troops and so does France, so Germany begins to sweat a little and mobilizes pre-empitvely.
	- *Schlieffen* Plan was to invade France through Belgium, wipe them quick, then turn on Russia.
	- So, Germany is often blamed for escalating the situation. They immediately jumped to conclusions based on military assumptions and gave Austria free reign. (debated topic)

## The Conduct of War
- The expectation of a quick victory due to Bismarck
- There was both war enthusiasm and anxiety:
	- So called "August Experiences" as the troops headed out in August in good spirits.
- The Social Democrats had a dilemma; the gov't needs money to fight the war, and the Reichstag is the org that creates the budget.
	- The argument was that the SPD had to stand united with the nation during wartime for "national unity". So although the gov't was hostile to the SPD before, it was willing to join hands for the war.
	- SPD decided that the domestic truce was going to be their decision, and other Socialist parties did the same with their corresponding nations.
		- Mainly because the Socialist parties didn't want to live in the societies built by the other nations (lol)
	- Gov't gave concessions to the trade unions as well, which was huge.
- German volunteer soldiers were... oddly ecstatic... to be a part of this war.
- *All Quiet on the Western Front* was a film from the time period condemning the violence of WWI.
### Stalemate
- The failure of the German offensive leads to a standstill.
	- The use of new technologies to try and break the standstill ensue: gas, machine guns, tanks, etc.
- Germany had the most military deaths per day, at around 1000 per!

## Soldier Experiences
- There was actually a variety:
	- Disillusionment or homesickness
	- Boredom
	- Glorification
	- Resistance
	- Trauma

## Defeat
- The Army Command's Hindenburg and Ludendorff had much to answer for.
- The arrival of American troops sealed the German defeat.
