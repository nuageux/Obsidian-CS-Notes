#German #History
## The War at Home
- Was just as unprecedented as on the front.
- The concept of "total war" (mobilization of all resources) and the "maximum slaughter at minimum expense"
- Increased role of the state

## Wartime Economy
The war costed 156-60 billion marks...
- Financial Reserves (225 mil marks)
- Taxes (17%)
- Printing money , went from 7.2bil in circulation to 43.6bil -> Inflation (250%)
	- Inflation was not bad, though, because there was price freezing and wage control.
	- Will have implications for post-war period...
- War loans/bonds (67%)

### Securing Raw Materials and Food Supply
- The British blockade of German imports was brutal.
	- Led to death by starvation for hundreds of thousands of German civilians.
	- Also called the "turnip winter", as that was all there was to eat.
	- Spanish Flu fucked the Germans as well.
	- Visions of "autarky" (independence from the world market)
- The importance of science (like nitric acid and synthetic rubber)

## Securing the Workforce
- Only small increase of working women (+17%)
- Shift to other sectors (like armament and chemical industries)
- 1916 Auxiliary Service Law: the official recognition of labor unions vs restrictions on free movement and containment of strikes

## Wartime Social Tensions
- Between consumers and producers:
	- price caps led to black markets
	- city and country: city assumes country has a lot of food and are hostile to them
- Between capital and labor:
	- There's inflation, but wage freezes meant laborers couldn't pay for anything anymore.
- Between men and women:
	- Men are worried about their position in the workforce
	- Women like the financial independence jobs gave them
- Between soldiers and civilians:
	- Soldiers know the horrors of war while civilians don't, leading to large gaps of understanding.

## Politicization
- The Russian Revolution sets the tone and so does the US entry, with Wilson's "peace without annexation".
- Peace resolution of the Reichstag (1917) and the split on the Left.
- Formation of the Fatherland Party.
	- Calls for "victorious peace", with vast annexations and an anti-socialist, antisemitic outlook.
