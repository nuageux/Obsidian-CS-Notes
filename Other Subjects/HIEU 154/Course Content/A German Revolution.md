# The German Revolution of 1918 and 1919
## The Revolution from Above (and Below)
- The October-reforms and the appointment of Prince Max von Baden as Kaiser
- Became a parliamentary monarchy; the government is now responsible to the parliament (Reichstag) not the Kaiser
- Was felt that this was too little, too late
- The German Navy had its own revolution
	- Admirals last minute basically told the sailors to go on a suicide mission for German honor lol
	- Led to the soldier/worker council
	- "soviet" means council... freaked out a lot of people
	- This rebellion spread like mad
	- Demands:
		- Democratization of military, preventing suicide missions
		- Political democratizations
		- Economic democratistaion, "socialisiation" of key industries
			- a.k.a. state ownership of key industries
- Friedrick Ebert (SPD) becomes the Reichschancellor
- formation of the council of people's commissars

## Two Proclamations of the Republic (SPD vs Spartacus League)
- Both types of governments were declared so... what sort of legitimacy did the governments have?
- Eyes on Ebert... real revolution, or the moderate path? The moderate.
- Series of poor compromises
	- Military compromise... to support the government in exchange for preventing the bolshevik revolution in Germany
	- Capital and Labor... recognition of trade unions, 8 hour day, no socialization
	- No land reform was made...
	- No reform of the civil service... the elites aren't replaced!!
- Ebert is a proponent of order and organization
