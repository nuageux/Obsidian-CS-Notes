# The German Revolution of 1918 and 1919
## The Revolution from Above (and Below)
- The October-reforms and the appointment of Prince Max von Baden as Kaiser
- Became a parliamentary monarchy; the government is now responsible to the parliament (Reichstag) not the Kaiser
- Was felt that this was too little, too late
- The German Navy had its own revolution
	- Admirals last minute basically told the sailors to go on a suicide mission for German honor lol
	- Led to the soldier/worker council
	- "soviet" means council... freaked out a lot of people
	- This rebellion spread like mad
	- Demands:
		- Democratization of military, preventing suicide missions
		- Political democratizations
		- Economic democratistaion, "socialisiation" of key industries
			- a.k.a. state ownership of key industries
- Friedrick Ebert (SPD) becomes the Reichschancellor
- formation of the council of people's commissars

## Two Proclamations of the Republic (SPD vs Spartacus League)
- Both types of governments were declared so... what sort of legitimacy did the governments have?
- Eyes on Ebert... real revolution, or the moderate path? The moderate.
- Series of poor compromises
	- Military compromise... to support the government in exchange for preventing the bolshevik revolution in Germany
	- Capital and Labor... recognition of trade unions, 8 hour day, no socialization
	- No land reform was made...
	- No reform of the civil service... the elites aren't replaced!!
- Ebert is a proponent of order and organization
- National Assembly of Soldiers and Workers to decide what should happen now
	- Sanctions Ebert's policies, pretty much
	- Decides on election of National Assembly

## Radicalization and Repression
- Spartacus Uprising, 1919
- Ebert calls on his soldiers to supress Left protesters... the Freecorps lol
	- He is so scared of the Bolshevik Revolution
	- Luxemburg and Liebknecht were both assassinated
- Results in bitter split on the Left, because Ebert and the moderates basically sanctioned the violence.
	- So there isn't really a possibility to form a faction against the Right, who are rapidly gaining power.
- Repression of Bavarian "Councils Republic"
- Anti-Bolshevism
- Hitler is here during this time...! The idea of a Jewish Bolshevism

## Outcomes
- SPD wins by a lot, but not by more than 50% of the total.
	- Necessity of a "Weimar Coalition" to get this majority... not entirely Socialist!
- KPD, USPD, SPD, DDP, Zentrum, DVP, DNVP, NSDAP... Left to Right!
- Progressive in that there were many civil rights written into the Constitution.
- Art. 48 is what brings Hitler to power in the end.
