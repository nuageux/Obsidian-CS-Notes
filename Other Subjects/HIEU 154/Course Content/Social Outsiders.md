# Jewish Germans in Nazi Germany
- Goal of Nazi anti-Jewish policies is the reversal of Jewish emancipation.
- Legal discrimination: the law for the "reconstitution of the civil service" (1933).
- But also violence, harassment, peer pressure (anti-Jewish boycott in 1933).
- the Nuremberg Laws in 1935 defined the Jewish people of second-class citizens.
	- 3 Jewish grandparents defines you as Jewish.
		- ...but this information is found in synagogue records, so whatever happened to the theory of ethnicity?
- Obsession with sexual relations, because there is a threat of race-mixing.
	- The crime of "race defilement". Were publically humilated and legally prosecuted.
	- Pressure to dissolve mixed marriages.
- There was actually a propagandistic *retreat* from anti-semitism during 1936 Olympics.
	- Actually did convince other countries!
- There was increasing segregation in daily life... e.g. separate benches, "Jew-free" beachs, stores barring Jewish from shopping, etc.
- Nazi lawyers actually looked to America and thought their racist laws were too harsh... though did take inspiration from the U.S.
- **Krystalnacht, "the Night of Broken Glass"** is the turning point.
	- A Polish Jewish man shot a German soldier for some wrong, Nazi Germany uses this as an excuse to unleash all the pent-up violence on the Jewish.
	- This is when most Jewish people decided to leave. 60% managed to emigrate out.

# Sinti and Roma
- Another ethnicity that was just as persecuted as the Jewish.
- 

# The Mentally Ill and Disabled
- Propaganda declaring things like money spent keeping a mentally ill person alive kept a whole healthy family alive.
- "T4" program where the mentally ill were picked up in vans and deported to killing centers.
