- Unification of nation state to collapse and disappearance
- Song of the Germans
	- fatherland
	- uniuty is a big theme
	- inwards vs outwards stanzas
	- germany was a bunch of separate states
	- but later "over all" referred to germany's superiority over other nations
		- so now third verse only sees main use while 1st is frowned upon
	- unity, justice, freedom
		- order of this statement matters?
	- meanings change over time, values exchange
- jewish population before holocaust in germany was only 1%, most jewish were killed in poland
- socialist majority in germany before nazi rise...
- huge jump in vote share for nazi party, from 2% to 37%

office hours questions
- im not interested in germany because it feels too mainstream like the holocaust in terms of history education
- i prefer a hybrid because it means that less people attend class, i like the extra space and i can take more of the professors attention
- i feel uncomfortable about diary entry assignments because it feels presumptuous to even imagine that i had gone through the same pains these people have. 
- people give up freedom because being free isn't all that great when the system is stacked against you.
- peaky blinders line... "i learned that if politics is a circle. if you go left enough and right enough... socialism and fascism meet here."
