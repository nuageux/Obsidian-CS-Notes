## Weimar's Modernity
- Vibrancy of Weimar Cultural Life
- From Elite to Mass Culture
	- Is mass culture emancipatory and democratic or manipulative and repressive?
	- Does new media promote or undermine democracy?
- Increase of Leisure Time, Concept of the 'Weekend'
- A democratic culture for a democratic society

## Politicization of Art
- Increasingly more often, artists had a message to put into their pieces.
- Pieces of Weimar culture are revealed in artwork:
	- The youth liked to hang out on the rooftops of Berlin

## Architecture and Design: the Bauhaus
- The philosophy of the Bauhaus, an innovative design school in Germany, was the social responsibility of art and architecture.
	- Both functional and practical
	- A democratic culture for a democratic society
	- Affordable but new housing
- The curriculum was varied and had students learn how to work with a large range of mediums.
	- Had gendered issues, however: Some advisors made women do art typical to their gender role (e.g. sewing).
- Interior design
- Abolishing "fractur", the old traditional typescript to the modern one famous today.

## Mass Communication: the Radio
- Radio was actually highly regulated in Germany
- Eight regional braodcasting companies, one national
- A semi-public or public enterprise
- Radio supposed to "uplift" the listener
	- So classical concerts, operas, lectures only played at night
- An appeal to the middle class
- "Defensive modernization"
- A new medium... for manipulation, or liberation?
- Nazis really pick this up

## "Americanism" and Mass Culture
- A method of the "concrete and of energy. completely attuned to spiritual and material reality."
- "Fordism" and the idea of mass production and mass consumption of what used to be a luxury good.
- Hope for a techno-cratic solution to class conflict.
- Ford was super anti-union though, and an anti-semite at that. 
- Hollywood Movies
	- Charlie Chaplin!
- Jazz and black music
	- VÃ¶lkerschauen in Wilhelmine Germany, displaying black people as a zoo
	- Anti-colonial agitation, demand for equality, Martin Dibobe
	- Maybe about 25-30k black Germans in Weimar
- The Charleston dance
	- A fast-paced, wild dance
	- Josephine Baker, a black woman from America, who was intensely popular
		- Reaction was mixed, one of fascination yet very racialized
	- Nearly naked performances by women

## Anti-Americanism and Kulturkritik
- Predictably by the Nationalist right
- Claimed mass culture was undermining national sovereignty and traditional hierarchies
- "Cultural Bolshevism" and "Jewishness"
- The Frankfurt School to counter the Bauhaus
	- Critique of standardizing tendencies of mass culture, uniformity 
	- Capitalist domination
	- "Art in the age of theoretical reproduction"
