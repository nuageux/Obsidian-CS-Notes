#German #History 
## Germany in the World
- Globalization around 1900:
	- Germany was very integrated in world trade.
	- German emigration was high, a "diaspora".

## Foreign Policy
- Bismarck's Alliance System
	- Isolating France was the main goal.
	- Secondary goals were to make Germany a "saturated power" and the "honest broker".
	- Additionally to divert European conflicts to the extra-European sphere.
	- And critically, to prevent hostile coalitions.
- Wilhelm II will ruin it all.

#### World Policy under Wilhelm II
- The quest for a "place in the sun":
	- Plan is for Germany to build a bigger navy to match the British.
		- Didn't work, b/c it was kind of a large hurdle to begin with, and on top of it all, it pissed off the British.
- Everything falls apart and all the Great Powers form alliances without Germany in them. 
- What will the Kaiser do to escape being encircled...?

## German Colonialism
- Bismarck was initially uninterested, but soon changed his tune.
	- A main reason was to be "as good as" the other Great Powers, the "new imperialism".
- A sort of "social imperialism" to deflect the internal political tensions.
#### Genocide of the Herero and Nama
- German forces botched attempts to quell a revolution so badly, their actions just compound into atrocities that became progressively worse until it became a genocide. 
- Tactics of pursuit and extermination were carried out.
- Imprisonment and death camps ensued, perhaps as a prelude to the Holocaust.
#### Hull's Argument
- "Military culture" led to much of Germany's atrocities.
- Wilhelmine Germany actually allowed civilian politicians some reign over decisions made (as opposed to Nazi Germany).
- See passages on Lothar von Trotha and his incompetence.
- Reminder that colonial genocide was not exclusive to the Germans.
