#German #History
## The Establishment of the Nazi Dictatorship
- Recall the situation on January 30th, 1933: Hitler is now Chancellor, but is "framed" by conservatives.
	- Hitler's question is how to overcome his dependency on Hindenburg.
- The burning of the Reichstag and the "Law for the Protection of the People and the State" in 1933
	- Responsibility? van der Lubbe recounts the traditional view while Hett recounts the revisionist view.
- The "Day of Potsdam", a ceremony for the re-opening of the Reichstag.
- The Law to Remove the Distress of the People and the State (**The Enabling Act**) allowed Hitler to override the Reichstag whenever he pleased.
	- Otto Wels's speech against the Enabling Act. Took guts.
	- Could the SPD have done more?
- Soon in July, the Nazi Party is the only legal political party left in Germany.

## Terror
- Early concentration camps such as Columbia Haus Berlin.
- A campaign against Weimar Culture:
	- The "Action against Un-German Spirit" book burning in May
- Anti-Semitism through boycotting Jewish business
	- ...bolstered with a certificate for "Christian business"

## Consent: The Nazification of German Society
- There were 800k NSDAP members in January... 1.5M in March!
- Attitude of intellectuals, e.g. Martin Heidegger was generally supportive of the Nazis
- The Christian churches did not oppose Nazi rule either, the Pope even signing the *Reichsconcordat*.
- The Protestant Church
- German Christians

## Conflict with the SA
- Ending the revolution versus demand for a second revolution
- Conflict with the SA and critique from the right
- The "Night of Long Knives"
- The justification of mass murder and popular reactions to that

## The Hitler Myth: Triumph of the Will
- Ernst Fraenkel's "The Dual State", defining:
	- Normative state: an administrative body endowed with elaborate powers for safeguarding the legal order as expressed in statues, decisions of the courts, and activities of administrative agencies.
	- Prerogative state: a governmental system which exercises unlimited arbitrariness and violence unchecked by any legal guarantees.
- He also declares Hitler as "*FÃ¼hrer* and *Reichschancellor*".
