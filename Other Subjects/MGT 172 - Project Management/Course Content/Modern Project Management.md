# What is a Project?
"A complex, nonroutine, one-time effort limited by time, budget, resources, and performance specifications designed to meet customer needs."
- Has an established objective.
- Has a defined life span with a beginning and an end.
- Typically requires across-the-organizational participation.
- Can involve doing something never been done before.
- Has specific time, cost, and performance requirements.

### Programs
Are a series of **coordinated, related, multiple projects** that continue over an extended time and are intended to achieve a goal.
- Ex: A project is analogous to a course at university, while a program is analogous to the completion of one's degree.

# Project Management
"Is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techinques to project activities to meet project requirements." 
A Project Manager must balance the competing demands of:
- Technical (quality), schedule, and cost
- Customer, management, and project team expectations
- Identified project requirements and customer expectations

### Projects vs. Routine Operations
**Projects** are unique, have a limited life span, have multiple stakeholders, are sponsored, have a variable demand for resources, and have an element of uncertainty.
**Routine Operations**, on the other hand, are repetitive, are continuous, have a department, have a supervisor, have a stable demand for resources, and have an element of stability.

### Scalability of Project Management
The management of any project is influenced by:
- Perceived risk
- Project size
- Project complexity

...which all determine:
- Amount of detail required for planning and monitoring project performance
- When the planning effort occurs
- Functionality requirements for tools
- Level and appropriateness of reporting

## The Project Life Cycle
Projects are usually divided into several project phases to provide better management control. Activities are interrelated across phases and may overlap!
- Defining
	- Goals
	- Specifications
	- Tasks
	- Responsibilities
- Planning
	- Schedules
	- Budgets
	- Resources
	- Risks
	- Staffing
- Executing
	- Status reports
	- Changes
	- Quality
	- Forecasts
- Closure
	- Train customer
	- Transfer documents
	- Release resources
	- Evaluation
	- Lessons learned

Each project phase typically completes one or more deliverables.
- Ex: Software development has requirements, high-level design, detailed design, coding, testing, and installation.

Projects typically experience a slow start, build up speed, and slowdown near completion.

# About the Project Manager
- Manages temporary, non-repetitive activities and frequently acts independently of the formal organization.
	- Marshals resources for the project
	- Provides direction, coordination, and integration to the project team
	- Manages a diverse set of project stakeholders
	- Dependent upon others for technical answers
	- Is responsible for performance and success of the project
- Must induce the right people at the right time to address the right issues and make the right decisions.
