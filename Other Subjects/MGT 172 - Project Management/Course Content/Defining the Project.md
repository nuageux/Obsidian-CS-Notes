#Management #Project 
# Step 1: Scope
A definition of the end result or mission of the project in specific, tangible, and measurable terms.
- Clearly define deliverables for the customer
- Focus the project on completion of its goals
- Use as a planning tool and for evaluating project success

Is also known as the **Statement of Work** (scope statement).
- There can also be a **Project Charter**, which contains an expanded version of the scope statement (SOW), which authorizes the PM to initiate and lead the project.
- **Scope Creep** is the tendency for the project scope to expand over time due to changing requirements, specifications, and priorities.

Checklist:
1. Project Objective
2. Deliverables
3. Milestones
4. Requirements
5. Limits and Exclusions
6. Reviews with Customer

### Requirements
- Communicate the customer's needs, wants, and expectations to system stakeholders
- Defines what must be developed
- Represents the contractual agreement between buyer and project team
- Requirements drive the structure of the project through the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).

Understand the project... Review all documentation!
- Technical
	- System Capabilities
	- Interfaces
	- Performance
	- Data
	- Availability, maintainability, portability, reliability, quality, etc.
- Schedule
	- Milestones
	- Payment schedule
	- Deliverables
	- Service Levels
	- Help desk response time
- Cost
	- Budget
	- Funding
- Contractual
	- Intellectual property
	- Warranty
	- Penalties
	- International law
	- Acceptance Criteria

*Poorly defined requirements increase the risk of project failure*.
- Carefully consider the requirements, which are typically more specific and fine-grained compared to the broad scope of the project.
- Are complete, consistent, correct, unambiguous, measurable, traceable, design-free, necessary.
- Addresses capabilities, limitations, performance, interfaces, and quality.

# Step 2: Priorities
Recall the [[The Customer#^0aa4e8|Iron Triangle]]. We must balance Cost (budget), Time (schedule), and Scope (performance), with Quality in the middle.
- **Constrain**: a parameter is a fixed requirement.
- **Enhance**: optimizing a parameter over others.
- **Accept**: reducing a parameter requirement.

# Step 3: Work Breakdown Structure
A deliverable oriented *hierarchical decomposition of the work* to be executed by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.
- Defines the total scope of the project.
- Decomposes the work into managaeable tasks which can be defined, scheduled, budgeted, organized, statused, and controlled.
- Completion type projects are deliverable oriented.
- Services type projects are functionally oriented.
- Facilitates evaluation of the Iron Triangle of the organization of a project
- Helps generate the organization breakdown structure (OBS), which assigns project responsibilities to organizational units and individuals.

### Three Rules
1. 100% Rule
	1. WBS includes 100% of the work defined for the project.
	2. Sum of the work at the lower levels of the WBS must equal 100% of the work at the higher rollup level
2. Mutually Exclusive Elements
	1. There is no overlap between WBS elements.
3. Progressive Elaboration
	1. Each level of the WBS provides further detail and definition

Project -> Deliverable -> Subdeliverable -> Lowest subdeliverable -> Cost account -> Work Package

# Step 4: Codifying the WBS
Makes it easier to use in a nicely formatted document.

Functional elements may be decomposed into lower levels of activities 
- Decomposition under fundamental elements may still be product-oriented
- Activities need not be in a particular order among their siblings, as long as they are under the correct parent

Go as low as to the level of management visibility required and to develop accurate estimates and manage risks.
- The more risk there is, the more detail you include.

### Work Packages
Are the basic units used for planning, scheduling, and controlling the project, and is the lowest level of the WBS.
- Describes the "verbs" of the project, and is the only section of the WBS that does so.
	- Recall that the "nouns" are the deliverables.
- Make sure the project team has a clear understanding of who is doing what.

### Control Accounts
Focal points for data collection and comparisons of work performed against the plan
- Integrates work and responsibility
- Assigned to a person who monitors and controlsthe technical, schedule, and cost of the defined scope
	- "Control Account Manager" (CAM)
- Has work and planning packages
# Step 5: Integration with Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS)
Essentially allocates work packages to the appropriate individuals, groups, or organizations.
- **Responsibility Assignment Matrix** (RAM): A structure that relates the project OBS to the WBS to help ensure that each component of the project's scope of work is assigned to a person or team.
	- Creates a project control point (control account that integrates work and responsibility)
	- Useful for large and complex projects
	-  Projects with ditributed teams
	-  Teams with many partners
