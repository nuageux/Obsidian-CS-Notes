#Management  #Project 
## Strategic Management Process
Is the process of assessing "what we are" and deciding and implementing "what we intend to be and how we are going to get there."
- Implemented through projects, and every project should be clearly related to the organization's strategy.
- Provides the theme and focus on the future direction of the organization.
	- Responding to changes in the (external) environment
	- Allocating scarce resources of the firm to improve its competitive position (internal)

#### Driving Forces
- Global Competition: How to stay alive as a company as the field expands.
- Shortened Project Life Cycles: The product must come out near *immediately* or it's essentially dead in the water.
- Industry Consolidation: Less and less companies are entering certain industries.
- Accountability: If our company has lost credibility, how do we gain back our customers' trust? How do we establish a certain ethos?

#### Four Activities of the SMP
1. Review and define the organizational mission
2. Set long-range goals and objectives
3. Analyze and formulate strategies to reach objectives
4. Implement strategies through projects

#### Objectives should be "SMART"
Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, Timed

## Project Portfolio System
Process of selecting a group of projects for implementation
- Balanced by project type, risk, and ranking by selected criteria.
- Ensures that projects are aligned with the strategic goals and are *prioritized* properly.
- Provides information that helps people make better decisions.
- Organized into **Compliance** (must-do), **Operational** (organizational or systemic), and **Strategic** (goal-focused) projects.

### Selecting a Model
Applying a scoring model to tie projects closer with the organization's strategic goals.
- **Financial**: payback, net present value (NPV)
	- **Payback**: The time it takes to recover our project investment; *the  shorter the better*. Problems:
		- Ignores the time value of money. 
		- Assumes cash inflows for only the investment period (and not beyond), doesn't consider profitability
	- Payback (years) = Estimated Project Costs / Annual Savings
		- a.k.a. **= Investment / Inflows**
	- **Net Present Value Model**: Uses management's minimum desired rate-of-return (discount rate) to compute the present value of all net cash inflows.
		- Positive means the project meets the minimum desired rate of return and is eligible for further consideration, Negative means the project is simply rejected.
- **Non-Financial**: projects of strategic importance to the firm (ex: reputation, limiting competition)

#### Multi-Weighted Scoring Models
Introduce a list of criteria for projects, give them a subjective numeric score for each criterion category, then multiply by the weight given to the criterion.
