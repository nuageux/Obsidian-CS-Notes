should...
- be specific
	- shouldn't be open for interpretation
- be answerable with data
- specify what's being measured

working towards a good question?
- starts with a dumb, vague problem
- improve

after question is defined, should it become a project?
- is there even data for it?

# kinds of analysis
- know techniques and their advantages and their limits
- must know techniques that are better than just guessing
- descriptive analysis -> exploratory -> ? 
	- inferential
	- predictive
	- causal
	- mechanistic
- descriptive should not have opinion or interpretation.
- exploratory, usually graphical. no confirmation of reality, however
- inferential analysis to confirm that our observations were probably better than chance
- predictive is machine learning or statistical learning
- causal

interpolation vs extrapolation
- using data to predict data points within the range of already studied data
- vs predicting data points outside the range of already studied data (extrapolation). extrapolation is likely to be wrong.
