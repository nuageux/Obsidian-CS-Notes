$s^* \in S$ is a **Nash Equilibrium** if, for every player $i$, $s_i$ is a best response to $s_{-i}$.
- Every player’s strategy in this strategy profile (matrix square) is a best response/undominated.

### Finding Nash Equilibria
- Find player 1’s best responses to player 2’s strategies. Underline player 1’s payoffs for player 1’s best responses.
- Do the same for player 2.
- If both payoffs are underlined for a strategy profile (matrix square), this strategy profile is in Nash equilibrium.

Choosing a different strategy will not result in gains in a Nash equilibrium.

If both players are playing their only best response, it is in **strict** Nash equilibrium. **Not equivalent to efficiency!**

A player’s belief about another player isn’t necessarily consistent with the other player’s actual strategy.

- Social and Economic institutions that serve to align the beliefs and behavior of players exist.
    - Ex: Pre-play communication/contracts, where players come to an agreement.
- If it makes sense for both players to want to honor the agreement, this agreement aligns their behavior into a specific strategy profile.
    - For this to be the case, the agreed upon strategy profile must be a best response for both players.
- If any player would rationally want to switch from a certain strategy profile, then it’s not a Nash equilibrium.
