## Calculating Nash Equilibria in Games with Infinite Strategy Spaces using Calculus

How to calculate equilibria of $n$-player games with an infinite number of pure strategies:

- **Determine** if we can use _calculus_ to find the best-response functions.
    - 1st Order Condition: Payoff functions must be _differentiable_.
    - 2nd Order Condition: The second order derivative of the payoff functions must be **negative** (< 0).
        - We’re searching for maximums, so the graphs must be concave (hump).
- **Take the first order derivative of each payoff function, and set them equal to 0**. **Solve for**
- If calculus doesn’t apply, rule out strategy profiles where a player is clearly not best responding.
