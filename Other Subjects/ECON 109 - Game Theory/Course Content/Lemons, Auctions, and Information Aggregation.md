# First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction Example
Auctions are often used to facilitate the trade of goods and services.

In an auction, there is *incomplete information*. Players know their own valuation of the item up for auction, but don't know the other players' respective valuations.

In the first-price auction, whoever bid more takes home the item. The payoff for the item winner is the player's valuation minus the amount the player bid (and is now paying). The payoff for everyone else is 0.

To simulate the respective player valuations of the item, we will represent the valuations as selected by a move of nature. Players then privately observe their own (randomly generated by nature) valuations. 
- Thus, we are dealing with functions; the bid amount for each player is the output of a function with the respective valuation as the input.
- We need to find out if these functions rest at a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium.

We will set Nature's random selection to be from a uniform distribution.

# Second-Price Auction Example
The only important difference from the first-price auction is that instead of the winner paying their bid, they pay the second-highest bid after their own.
