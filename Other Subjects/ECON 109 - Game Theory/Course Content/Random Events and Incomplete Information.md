## Details of the Extensive Form: Nature
Incorporating "exogenous random events" by introducing the concept of "nature".
- Usually called Player 0.
- Decision nodes are shown as open circles.
- *Non-strategic*, i.e. there are no payoffs for nature.
- Mixed strategy for nature is typically specified as a parameter of the game (because nature is inherently random).

#### Incomplete Information
As opposed to imperfect information:
- The game has at least one move of nature.
- Players have different information about nature's choices (which is private information).
	- A player's "type" refers to *what this player observes* about nature's actions.

### Bayesian Normal Form

Is where we put together the payoff vectors in normal form as the **expected values** when considering the random moves by Player 0 (nature).
