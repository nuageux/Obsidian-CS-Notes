#Economics #Game-Theory 
## Review of the perspective of Neoclassical Economic Theory
- “Anonymous, large, perfectly competitive markets”
- Single-person decision problems (consumers and firms)
    - i.e. individual decision problems
- Buying and selling through centralized markets
- Price parameters (firms and consumers take as given)
- **No interaction directly between people** (they don’t care about each other’s activities)

### Contrast that with a Strategic Setting
- People generally care about each other’s actions
    - i.e. my behavior directly affects your welfare
- We use the term _interdependence_
- Relates to both market and non-market interaction
- Examples:
    - A market with a _small_ number of firms
        - Like a monopoly
    - Coworkers choosing tasks to complete and effort expended
        - Such as choosing a complementary task because someone else chose a certain task
    - Countries setting tariffs
    - Sports and card games, etc.

### Game Theory is... (not neoclassical economics)
- The mathematical analysis of strategic settings, which we call “games”.
- In general, optimal choices depend on the behavior of others.
    - And even what one believes about how others will behave!
- Scope:
    - Conflict, competition, sometimes zero-sum
        - i.e. directly opposing preferences. If I get something good, you get the equal “bad”.
    - Cooperation, coordination
        - Consider what goes on within a team
    - Applications in economics, business, international relations, law, politics, philosophy, etc.
- We will try to develop an understanding of how people actually behave, and how they should be advised to behave in strategic situations
    - Leading to a theory of strategic interaction
- John von Neumann is like the “father” of Game Theory
    - John Nash expanded to “noncooperative” and “cooperative” models

## Terminology: Components of a Game
- A list/set of _**players**_, typically _$n$_ of them
- A complete description of their feasible _**actions**_
    - Ex: Firms can choose what prices they wish to set
- A description of the _**information**_ players have when they must take actions
    - Describing the lack of information is important, too
- A specification of how their actions lead to _**outcomes**_
- A specification of their preferences over outcomes (_**payoffs**_).
    - i.e. how much a player likes an outcome, usually described numerically
- Rules are synonymous with our abilities to agree on what game is being played

## Analyzing Games
- We need a precise mathematical way of _representing_ games and a way to formulate:
    - The _beliefs_ the players have about each other
    - The meaning of _rational behavior_
        - How should a player play according to their belief(s)?
    - _Solution concepts_
        - Putting rational behavior together, we come up with a concept of generally how games might be played
        - Predictions about the outcomes of games
    - _Efficiency_ and other standards of evaluation
        - Measuring payoffs. Which outcome is better?
- The Noncooperative framework treats all of the agents’ actions as _individual actions_.
    - Doesn’t mean there are no group actions; just need to consider things like offers and counteroffers
    - Hard to actually apply in real life, though
- “Strategic Uncertainty”: not knowing for sure what other players will do
- The Cooperative framework is where the outcome of negotiation is simply treated as a “joint action”
    - Preferred for “contractual relationships”
    - Contract selection and enforcement
    - Objects of negotiation are “spot-contractible”, where agreements on a joint-action commit players to take the action.
