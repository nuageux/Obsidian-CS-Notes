## The Vision Problem
It is *incredibly* difficult to program a computer to have vision, even just vision that is as good as a two-year-old!

Examining adults who gain vision later in life
- Ex: Woman who could distinguish objects by touch could not distinguish those same objects when viewing them side-by-side on a table.

Vision is difficult especially because there are an infinite number of 3D scenes that could give rise to a particular 2D image.
- Furthermore, the same object can give rise to multiple 2D images.
- The visual system is quite plastic (over many time scales).

## How we Study Vision
- Physiology
	- Single Cell Electrophysiology: What neurons respond to
	- Optical Imaging: What groups of neurons respond to
	- Microstimulation
- Psychophysics
	- Observing and analyzing 
		- Visual illusions
		- People with brain damage
- Computational Modeling
	- Make models that do similar things and see how they work
	- Start with learning rules and see what happens

Higher-level neurons require more complex stimuli. 
Neurons near the end of the temporal pathway respond to very complex stimuli.

### Determining Function
- We know that neurons in a particular area respond well to a particular kind of stimulation. Does that imply that these neurons are telling "us" about these stimuli?
	- Microstimulation: how does an animal respond when we stimulate it with a certain stimulus?

### Feedback and Feedforward Systems
Vision is influenced by prior experience, the surroundings, recent prior exposure, learned familiarity with special objects, and concurrent input in other sensory modalities.
- Vision is not simply a feedforwards system.
- The McCollough Effect: Seeing afterimages of colors after staring at them for a while
- The McGurk Effect: A video of a mouth is saying something different than the audio played, making us mishear.
