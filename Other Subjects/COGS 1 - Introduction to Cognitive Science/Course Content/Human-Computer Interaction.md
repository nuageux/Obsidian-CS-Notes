# Human-Computer Interaction
### Thinking with Computers
- Thinking happens [[Distributed Cognition & Cognitive Ethnography#^7bee72|in the world]] as well as in the head.
	- It is a distributed situated social activity.
	- Today, we increasingly think with computers.
## Computers are Special
Specifically, computers provide a new kind of "stuff" out of which we can fashion dynamic, interactive systems to assist thought, communication, collaboration, and social interaction.
- Computation provides the most plastic medium for representation, interaction, and communication we have ever known.
	- Mimic existing media
	- Create new media
	- Modify existing media
	- Create models that ever more accurately represent the real world
	- Provide virtual worlds
	- Combine the real and virtual
- Our activities are increasingly mediated by computers.

#### Xerox Parc and the Alto
In 1969, Peter McCullough, the Xerox CEO decides Xerox should be the "architect of information".
- The Parc Legacy: the personal computer, ethernet, laser printing, object-oriented programming, icons and desktop metaphor, etc.

"The best way to predict the future is to invent it." -Alan Kay

## Changing the Form of Computers
The boundary between physical and digital worlds is becoming permeable.
- We already know about how phones are a "pocket computer".
	- Increasingly we have multiple and may not even think of them as computers!
	- The network it connects us to changes our professional, personal, and social lives.
- Xbox "Kinect" projects onto a surface and visually scans to see the hand interactions.
- The "ObjecTop" computer which is a desk that is aware of physical objects that are on top of it.

# Data Revolution
We are now in a world of sensors that collect an intense amount of potentially new and myriad data very inexpensively.
- Extending data collection into situations that have not typically been accessible
- Enablind examination of the fine detail of action captured in meaningful settings
- Importantly, the scale with which we can examine things is on a much wider spectrum now.

Example: The medical computer interfaces can be much improved.
- You might recognize the situation where you are undergoing a physical examination and your doctor must click an unnecessary amount of times through an outdated interface to get to the information necessary.
#### Activity-Enriched Computing
A good way to capture activity is to record video.

Example: Attribute-Mapped Scrollbars, to see the activity when editing a document or code.

Example: Experiment where cameras are posted all over a car and new types of data were recorded (such as a foot-cam to see what people did with the gas and brake pedals).

But, too much data isn't necessarily a good thing. Some researchers feel like they're drowning in data; the question then turns to how much data is necessary, but also how to parse through large sums of data efficiently.
- The critical challenge is how we can fully capitalize on the opportunity provided in the revolution in activity data capture.

#### Activity Trails: Episodic Access to Digital Activity
By recording activity done on a screen and replaying it back to the relevant individual, that individual remembered very well the circumstances surrounding that activity.
- We can better remember context of activity-sessions (like work) with the help of computers!
