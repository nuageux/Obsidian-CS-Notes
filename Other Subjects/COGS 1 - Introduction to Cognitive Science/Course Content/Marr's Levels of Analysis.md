#CogSci 
# Marr’s Levels of Analysis

A framework to explain how cogsci is trying to explain its problems.

Allows interdisciplinary cooperation, so anyone can work on it.

For example, how to work through different jargon from different fields.

Remember how we began using symbolism and models, especially with regards to computers, to understand the mind.

Marr was the vision scientist from last lecture.

He wanted to understand phenomena by asking:

What problems does the system solve, and why?

How does it solve these problems? What representations, steps, or symbols does it use?

How is this instantiated in the brain or system? How do the neurons (or circuits) actually work?

In other words:

Computational [abstract] level

Input → BLACKBOX → Output

Don’t worry about what goes on within the blackbox.

Helps determine which inputs and outputs we study.

Algorithmic level

What does the blackbox do?

What are the steps?

Implementation [concrete] level

What is the blackbox? What’s it made of?

Specify how elements of the system work together to enable the algorithm which produces the response.

Solving any of these questions gives information leading to the solutions towards the other two.

These questions are aimed at different levels of understanding.

Multiple Realizability

The thesis that a “mental process” can be implemented by different physical entities.

So, if a computer and a brain both accomplish the same algorithms, it is arguable that they are functionally identical.
