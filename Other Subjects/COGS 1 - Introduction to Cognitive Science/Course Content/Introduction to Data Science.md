# What is Data Science?
The **essence** of data science is how *observing*, *quantifying*, and *fitting equations* to **numbers** can teach us the *fundamental laws of the universe*.
- "By 
	- turning many observations into numbers, we can 
		- i.e. quantification, wrangling, and storage
	- fit equations to them or 
		- i.e. mathematical modeling and parameterization
	- learn relationships between them, which lets us 
		- i.e. machine learning and artificial intellligence
	- understand how observations relate and sometimes 
		- i.e. inference
	- guess what might happen in the future."
		- i.e. prediction
- Note how "turning", "we", "learn", "lets us understand", and "guess what might happen" are all examples of cognitive phenomena!

## Neural Data Science
How can **data-driven approches** lead to **knowledge discovery**?
- We have machines look for connections between concepts to see how they interrelate, and then have them search for *gaps*, missing connections where topics *should* be related but aren't.
	- i.e. We can use data itself to generate new hypotheses *for us*!
