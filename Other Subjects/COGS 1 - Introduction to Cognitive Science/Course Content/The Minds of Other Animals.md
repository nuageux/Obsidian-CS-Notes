Cognition is “adaptive engagement with the world”
- how to cope with the myriad problems animals face

How to study:
- begin by assessing species specific sensory motor constraints
- general learning principles (across animals)
- include ecological demands on cognition
- examine implications for understanding human cognition

#### ex: species specific sensory motor constraints
- seagulls have ultra violet coloring on their wings that humans cannot see
    - We can‘t even imagine what a color we’ve never seen looks like!
- what constraints animals have affect the types of tests we will want to run on them
- dolphins have no color vision: they are instead sensitive to motion & high contrast
    - researchers had fucked up tests before cuz they didn’t know these
- “match to sample”, where a sample is presented, taken away, then reinforced when given a choice between a sample and something else

Primates have:
- Forward facing eyes
    - grants good depth perception
    - good for high altitude tree travel
- Opposable thumbs and grasping hands
    - rats have them too, but they can’t see what they’re holding.
    - primates can see what they’re holding, granting them hand-eye coordination (which is a huge advantage)
        - leads to tool use
- Other: trunk eye coordination (elephants), eye beak foot coordination (crows/birds)

## General Learning Principles
- what applies to most if not all animals
- animals in general tend to detect & use **Event Correlations**
    - when events co-occur, with experience, animals will use event 1 to predict event 2
    - pavlov’s dog, remember?
        - must have temporal contiguity, however (events must be close in time)
    - birds look for worms after rain, flying insects when sunny
- **win-stay, lose-shift**
    - if something’s working, keep doing it, if it’s not, switch it up
    - “don’t fix what ain’t broke”
    - ex: pigeons in a skinner box
    - note that this is adaptive behavior

BUT, even these widespread learning principles are sometimes overridden by **ecological demands**.
- hummingbirds do poorly at win stay lose shift
    - strategy is win shift! because once a flower is sucked dry, why would you want to go back?
- keep **ecological validity** in mind when designing cognitive experiments
- taste aversion (feeling sick) learning doesn’t follow rules. needs an hour break
    - rats will taste new food and wait before eating more
    - but, rats will not form associations between food and illness if the relation is immediate, because in real life, if food was poison, it would take 1 hour for the poison to take effect!

### Socioecology matters too
- primates get complicated
    - in a complex society, cognitive demands increase
    - in most animal societies, there’s a power hierarchy, a pecking order
        - power = ability to access resources
        - so in most “simple” hierarchies, all an individual has to know is who dominates them and who they dominate (”dyadic” relationship (two individuals))
    - for primates, power ≠ rank
        - ex: democracy
        - ex: **coalitions**, where C & D can group up to drive A away from the resource. means individuals have to pay attention not only to their own relationships, but also the relationships of others
            - if an odd call is heard (c does a dom call and gets a sub response from b) baboons will jump up and investigate!

How do we know what animals know?
- Cognitive maps (especially in rats) disproves behavioralist predictions
- prospective encoding
    - once a behavior is taught, we introduce interference to figure out what goes on inside the brain
    - like processes interfere with other like processes. so, introducing the relevant interference when the animal is looking for (or “prospecting” for) the next stimuli will confuse it (but not irrelevant processes)
- symbol use (for more complex symbols)
    - to determine how much of our thought is evolutionary (the “primate” in us) versus what requires a “human” mind
    - some animals can learn the human digits and even do spontaneous addition with those digits!
    - “greedy giveaway task”: chimps are rational with numbers, but not the actual quantity. _the symbol intercedes!_
        - consider implications for HUMAN cognition...
