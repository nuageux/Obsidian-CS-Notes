# A Brief History of Cognitive Science

-   From Behaviorism to Cognitivism
    -   Converging developments in multiple disciplines
    -   The Cognitive Revolution
    -   The start of CogSci
-   Post-cognitivism and UCSD

## Behaviorism

-   The dominant paradigm in psychology from approx 1920-1970.
-   Prior to behaviorism, the study of thinking and reasoning was “natural philosophy”.
    -   Mental events were studied with logical analysis, introspection, psychoanalysis was used.
-   The reaction to this was to make it truly scientific: needed objective measures of data. Introspection wasn’t trusted!
-   John Watson and B.F. Skinner are big names
    -   Rejected any study that used “inferred events” which were subjective opinions to them. Only the physical behavior was observable, according to them.
-   An attempt to make psychology a natural science.
-   Classical conditioning and operant conditioning paradigms were often used to explore behavior.
    -   “intelligence” was defined by a set of physical behaviors.
-   This is all before neurophysiology!
-   Was super successful. Thought process is embedded in psychology academia.

## Cognitive Revolution

-   Started around WWII! There were different ways of thinking about human intelligence, in _symbolic_ terms thanks to the growth of computation and human factors research.
-   Different ways of performing “intelligent” behaviors.
    -   Psychologists worked with the British Air Ministry to imporve human perfromance in radar detection, which required a super foreign skillset!
    -   Computer Scientists made automatic anti-aircraft firing control which reacted faster than people!
    -   Mathematicians in England worked to break the “Enigma code”.
-   Essentially, machines were made to solve computational problems faster than people.
-   Alan Turing! His work on codebreaking led him to _reconceive_ and _generealize_ intelligent behavior.
    -   “What can be computed?”
    -   Turing Machine was a thought experiment, where a general problem solving computer could carry out any mathematical computation given infinite time and memory.
    -   “Knowledge” could be formally conceptualized as _symbolic informtation_ and processed in very simple, discrete steps.
    -   Suggested that _intelligent capabilities_ like logic, learning, and memory, aren’t inherently biological!
-   So is the proposed Turing machine “intelligent”?
    -   The “Turing Test” (1950), a way to determine if the computer was truly performing in the same manner as a human would.
    -   If the computer can produce communication that is indistinguishable from a human operator, then the computer is said to be “intelligent”.
        -   This idea leads to the formulation of __artificial intelligence_._**
-   Can the human mind be represented as a computer?
-   David Broadbent (1958) used digital computers to make the _first flow diagram of a cognitive process._
    -   A description of what was happening in the mind.
-   Issues were framed as problems of **information processing**.
    -   Cognition was characterized as a kind fo computation, with the mind as software and the brain as hardware.
-   Reaction time studies (behaviorist/psychophysics) were used in humans to determine how long a mental process might take.
    -   Performance and errors gave clues to how the “pieces” of the mind fit together.
-   Work in biology and engineering allowed recording of what happened in the brain.
-   Hubel and Wiesel (1959) demonstrated the firing properties of cells in the brain with “single-cell recording”! Huge advance in information processing.

Recording from a Living Brain

-   By recording from different parts of the brain, they were able to show that the wiring diagram of the brain led to firing properties and the resulting behaviors.
    -   Ex: Retina prcoesses
-   Hierarchical processing, where simple info combines into increasingly complex information.

Modeling the brain

-   David Marr studied vision in the 60s and 70s.
-   How do we connect low-level feature detection with the high-level _goals_ of the visual system (seeing whole objects)?
-   Was thought if we discovered enough **feature detectors** (neurons that responded to a particular shape), we could just code the entire visual system.
    -   “**Methodological Reductionism**”, understanding something complex by reducing it to something simpler.

Birth of Cognitive Science

-   To solve complex problems, we need an interdisciplinary approach! Methodological Reductionism wasn’t enough.
-   We want to use analytic, observation, experimental, synthetic frameworks to create a _better_ science.
-   Funding came in around 1956 at MIT.
    -   Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
-   First meeting of the CogSci society was held at UCSD in 1979.
-   First CogSci Dept was founded at UCSD in 1986.

UCSD

-   Cognitivism(focus on computational models and neuroscience) seemed to miss the roles of context and the environment!
-   Dr Edwin Hutchins proposed that cognition isn’t limited to what happens in the brain!
    -   Cognition is dependent upon a dynamic interaction of the body with its environment, including other people and artifacts.
-   Idea that cognition is _fundamentally_ distributed beyond the individual is called **distributed cognition**.
    -   Led to “post-cognitivism”, the predominant approach at UCSD.
        -   Distributed Cognition: distributed across social and technological elements over time, not just in a single brain
        -   Situated Cognition: can’t be separated from the context in which it happens. If the situation changes, so does the cognition
        -   Embodied Cognition: shaped by the body of the agent, so cognition isn’t just dependant on the brain but also the senses, body structure, and motor abilities of the agent
