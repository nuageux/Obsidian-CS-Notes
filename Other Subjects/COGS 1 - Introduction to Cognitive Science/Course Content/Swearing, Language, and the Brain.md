# Profanity
- The most offensive English words are commonly slurs.
- Also a lot of profanity based on the body (functions) and copulation, and a few based on religion (goddamnit)
- These four categories are different in terms of relevance across world cultures, however.
    - Some subcategories, like disease’s relevance in the Dutch language, exist.
- It’s important profanity _**sounds**_ a particular way.
    - In English, profanity is very often a 4 letter word!
    - For shorter words (3 letter, 5 letter) there is more profanity than there are regular English words.
    - **1 syllable long, lots of consonants at the end**.
        - Consonants at the end signifies a “closed syllable”.
            - Opposite is “open” syllable”.
        - 95% of profanity.
- It’s important to note that societal norms tell societies which words are bad words and how “bad” it is if we say them (ex: France, Afghanistan).
- Cross-Cultural Differences
    - Some languages report to not have any equivalent to profanity.
    - Ex: Japan, where no words in particular are censored in media. Obviously some exceptions, as their language keeps adapting/evolving just as other languages do.
    - You probably wouldn’t offend people on the basis of the **words** you use.
- Differences across time, where profanity may have different degrees of offensiveness.
    - “Fuck” wasn’t particularly offensive in Shakespeare’s time.
    - People named “Richard” don’t go by “Dick” anymore!
        - In 1930’s, military slang referred to the handle of a riding crop (a “dick”) as a penis. (A lot of profanity originates from the military, unsurprisingly.)

### What Makes Profanity?
- A cultural belief that some words are bad (in some contexts). Not what the word refers to, _but the word itself_!
- This belief is applied to certain words (of which the pattern is discussed above).
- Cultural structures for reinforcing and propagating those norms (through generations) (by punishment, censorship, etc.).

### What Profanity Brings to Cognitive Science
- Speech Errors
    - When people talk quickly, when stressed, etc.
    - One explanation: They are thinking things they don’t want to say, which confuses them (Freudian slips).
        - Errors may reflect otherwise unstated and repressed thoughts (Freud).
        - **But**, given that assumption, _people should make more taboo errors than normal errors_ (in speech).
        - _There is selection bias_ when we notice more taboo errors than normal ones!
        - In reality, people make _much_ more normal errors than taboo errors.
    - There is a mechanism in our brain that allows us to censor ourselves (especially when the speech error could be socially costly).
        - How? Let’s examine an fMRI and see what happens when people successfully stop themselves from making an error.
        - The _right inferior frontal gyrus_ plays a role in inhibition control.
- Ex: Picture-Word Interference
    - If you are presented with a chance to say something taboo by accident, you’ll take (marginally, but statistically relevantly) longer to respond.
- Broca’s and Wernicke’s Areas (typically left hemisphere) are not the only ways to produce language, as shown by profanity.
    - Jacques Lordat had global aphasia but recovered(!!!) and then studied similar cases to himself. A certain case study only remembered “je” (”I”) and a swear word.
    - **Not** on the left-side of the brain!
    - Patient E.C. has a left brain tumor and _removed his entire left brain_, creating the expected side effects.
        - Language was crippled, but _swear words and emotional expletives were well-articulated and clearly understandable_.
    - Automatic-Aphasia case: A man who often cursed but after a stroke, none of his language was impaired _except the ability to curse_!
        - Damage in the **basal ganglia**, in the limbic system (deep inside the brain), in charge of suppressing actions based on the basis of emotional input.
        - Coprolalia: The uncontrollable production of taboo words and phrases (and is slightly associated with Tourette’s).
- Presents the possibility of “two pathways” to communicate, one abstract and rational (evolutionarily new), one direct and emotional (evolutionarily old).
