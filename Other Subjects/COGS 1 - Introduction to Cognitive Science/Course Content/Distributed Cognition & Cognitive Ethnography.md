# Distributed Cognition (the Theory)
### [[A Brief History of Cognitive Science |Before CogSci]]
- Behaviorism
	- Classical Conditioning, Stimulus-Response, Watson & Skinner
	- Don't care what's within the black box
- Cognitive Revolution
	- Used computational models as the primary metaphor for describing cognition.
	- The thought process is more important (the black box).
		- Concepts such as memory and decision-making were studied.
	- Some big names
		- George Miller
		- Noam Chomsky
		- Allen Newell
- Post-Cognitivism
	- Cognition isn't something that happens solely within the brain.
		- We must take context, environment, embodiement, culture, and artifacts into consideration.
	- Some big names
		- Don Norman
		- Edwin Hutchins
		- Jim Hollan

## Insights about Cognition
- You need a human brain to do human cognition.
- Humans have bodies, languages, artifacts, and live in complex built environments (not a vacuum).
- The mind and body interact in surprising and interesting ways.
- A person interacting with an environment for thinking can do things that a person in isolation cannot.
- Humans working together can do things that no person can do alone.
- Humans are highly social and our cognition depends on the fact that we have language and (especially) culture.

### Where is the Mind?
Is the mind in the brain? Is the computer a good model for the mind?
- We should think of the brain as a controller for body-world interaction.
- Humans live in complex social environments that are filled with cultural artifiacts.
- Our cognition and our mindfulness emerge from the interactions of our brains and bodies with this socio-cultural world (i.e. distributed).

## A Hypothesis about Cognition

^7bee72

Distributed Cognition states that cognition, in all its forms, **emerges** from the interactions among the elements of complex systems.
- Therefore, actions can reveal underlying cognitive processes. *Action is a form of cognition.*
- It is a theoretical framework for how cognition is distributed across material, social, and cultural systems, and the moves beyond the individual as the primary unit of analysis.

# Cognitive Ethnography (the Method)
"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible." -Oscar Wilde

Infer what is inside by observing what happens outside.

Ethnography is:
- A suite of methods:
	- The systematic study of the lifeworld of a community.
	- How the members of a community live, interact, communicate.
	- The material and ideational aspects of life.
- A product:
	- Documentation of a lifeworld.
	- An artifact that details our oberservations, inferences, and analyses.

So, Cognitive Ethnography is:
- Accurate records of specific instances of real world human behavior
- Analysis of the cognitive aspects of those instances
- Using wider ethnography as a source of knowledge about what is being done, what resouces are available for doing it, what conventions are used

## The Problem
- Our minds are adapted to systematically NOT see many aspects of the organization of activity
- This happens at all levels of organization
- We think we are seeing the world we live in, but most of the interesting details that must be understood to understand cognition in this world goes unnoticed.

#### Manifestations:
- We consider our own daily lives to be routing and uninteresting so we do not attend to the details.
	- Selective attention
- We fill in gaps in bisual scenes, thereby failing to see the gaps. We rely on the world to provide consistency.
	- Change blindness
- We ignore the background in scenes in order to better see the figure.
- We don't hear disfluencies in speech unless they are overwhelming.
- If we're lucky, we remember the gist of what people say to us, but rarely the exact words they used to say it.
	- When we're not so lucky, we only remember what we expected or wanted someone to say (and not what they said at all!).
- We understand the world thorugh cultural models that make some things obvious and make other things impossible to think, almost never seeing the cultural models that structure our understandings.
- We effortlesslprocess multiple sources of information, yet we rarely attend to the relations among these sources.
	- Like hand gestures.

## The Solution
The "Cognito-Scope" Model
- We must **slow down.**
	- Don't be in a hurry to understand!
	- Set aside time to look and reflect.
	- We can't multitask seeing the details in the world. Seeing in detail takes all of our attention.
- We must **be honest**.
	- We will feel temptations to fill in gaps in our observations, which we in turn must resist.
	- We must describe things as they are.
		- Not as we expect them to be. Not as we think they normally occur. Not as we would like them to be.

**think small.** --> "micro-anthology", where we look at a tiny timescale of activity and describe everything down to the most minute detail.

Pay attention to detailis, be methodical, plan our observations, and keep a clear distinction between data and analysis.

## Methods
- Observations and field notes
- Freezing action with photographs
- Overcoming the fleeting nature of speech by recording and transcribing interviews
- Capturing the rich, multimodul nature of interaction through video recording
- The application of theoretical and concpetual knowledge to analyze our ethnographic data

These methods help us notice social interactions, how things unfold over time, how cognitive tasks are the product of emergent behavios due to interaction, etc.
