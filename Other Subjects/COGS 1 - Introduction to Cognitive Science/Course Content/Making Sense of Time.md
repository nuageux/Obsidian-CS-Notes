# Making Sense of Time  

### “the embodied nature of human abstraction”

Do humans everywhere share the same fundamental abstract concepts?

-   Perhaps time is one of these concepts.

## Conceptualizing Time

-   Rather than perception or psychophysics
-   Ex: The future is a concept
-   Spacialized; ex: setting a clock.
    -   Linguistic: “way back when...” “week ahead of us” “almost here”
    -   Illustrations: Calendars!
    -   Many of these spatial bconceptualizations are unconscious
-   Three Spatial Frames of Reference
    -   Object-Centered
    -   Ego-Centered (An individual’s point of view) (Time)
    -   Geocentric
-   Deictic Time vs. Sequence Time
    -   Tensed vs Tenseless time
    -   relative to _now_ vs relative to _each other_
-   Deictic Time constructed Spacially
    -   Cross-culturally ego-centered pattern that preserves transitivity
        -   even evident in sign languages

## Universals? Radical Variations?

-   In Aymara (Andes), it is _sequential_ time! (still ego-centric)
    -   Future is _behind_ and past is _in front_!
    -   But people who don’t _speak the language_ are like the rest of us.
    -   Past is known and visible (front)
    -   Future is unknown, out of field of vision (back)
-   Non-Ego-centric time?
    -   Yupno (Papa New Guinea) [isolated group] (has 20% of the earth’s languages in such a small area!)
    -   Language based on uphill, downhill! Elevation is critical! Topography!
    -   Manual Gestures → 215 clearest gestrues selected (directionality, strokiness, displacement)
    -   Has Deictic center. Downhill is past, uphill is future. NOT EGO-CENTRIC!
    -   Future ISN’T OPPOSED to the past!

Humans conceptualize time one-dimensionally.

The Deictic center is associated w/ the ego’s co-location
