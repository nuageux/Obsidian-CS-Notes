# Fear

The brain is good at adapting to the environment at any time point. Fear is an extreme case of the brain responding to cues in the environment.

If trauma symptoms persist for a long time, it can be considered PTSD (which is considered to be something different from traumatic stress, which is less intense).

-   nightmares, detachment, flashbacks, insomnia, loss of appetite, irritability, etc.
-   cues still elicit a stress response

Motivation and emotion are inherently interconnected with action, reasoning, and decision making.

-   Theoretical perspective,
-   Neural perspective,
-   examples from current research

Autonomic nervous system

-   sympathetic, which allows you to take something emotional or motivational to do something
    -   flight or fight response is extreme (or freeze)
    -   but less extreme happens all the time, when we get excited about something
    -   constant information streams from say the internet keep this active too much!
-   parasympathetic
    -   helps you calm down

The brain and body communicate with each other!

we can’t just map functions to areas in the brain

the limbic system was supposed to be the “emotional brain”.

amygdala

-   activates many other systems to alert the brain in a big way

U-shaped function where emotional events are more likely to be remembered; but get too emotional and you’ll remember things wrong outright!

if given a drug (like to prevent stage fright) that prevents acceptance of norepinephrine in the brain, people have equal memory of boring and exciting events.

thalamus sends sensory info to other parts of the brain

fear conditioning

-   if the conditioning is persistant, it is PTSD. it is just acute stress disorder if just for a month. acute PTSD is 3 months, longer is chronic PTSD
-   one doesn’t “unlearn” fear. instead, a new process called “extinction” occurs.
    -   NOT the amygdala! by the infralimbic region in the prefrontal cortex.
    -   if you have a smaller prefrontal cortex, you won’t be able to extinguish fear memories (probably).
    -   different responses to learning and extinction, whereas amygdala makes no such distinction
-   can’t adjust if you can’t do extinction. anxiety. needs desensitivation therapy
-   so now that we learnt this, the new treatments focus on the prefrontal cortex instead.
-   if you’re constantly stressed out, you’re weakening your prefrontal cortex.
