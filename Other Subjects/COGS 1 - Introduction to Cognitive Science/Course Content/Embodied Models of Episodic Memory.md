# Embodied Models of Episodic Memory
**Why Models?**
- They remove ambiguity.
- They force us to state our assumptions.
- They alter our understanding of data.

But, we have to come up with models that help us understand what's going on *without getting too bogged down in unnecessary details*.
- develop theory $\rightarrow$ create simulation $\rightarrow$ test behavior in real world $\rightarrow$ compare with empirical data $\rightarrow$ develop another theory; a loop!

**Bodies?**
Language and memory is embodied:
- Ex: Metaphors that only make sense because we have physical bodies.
	- "I'm in over my head", "I'm warming up to her", etc.
- Ex: Muscle memory, where memory is outsourced.

The brain is embodied and the body is embedded in the world. Thus, AI's need robot bodies because the solutions to our questions *may* lie within the interaction of the body with the environment.

### Case Study: Clive Wearing
Was a renowned conductor, musicologist, and keyboardist who contracted a form of herpes virus that caused massive damage to his medial temporal lobe (which contains the hippocampus). Turned out to be one of the most severe cases of anterograde amnesia ever recorded, not to mention the additional partial retrograde amnesia.
- Anterograde amnesia is the inability to form new memories.

### Case Study: Patient H.M.
Patient Henry Gustav Molaison, who had surgery to remove his medial temporal lobe to control severe epilepsy, resulting in severe anterograde amnesia. This led to the understanding of how the MTL affects memory formation.

**Memory is composed of:**
- Short-term memory
- Long-term memory, which is composed of:
	- Explicit (or conscious) memory, which is further divided into
		- Semantic memory
		- Episodic memory
	- Implicit (or unconscious) memory, which more specifically can be referred to as
		- Procedural memory

## Episodic Memory
- Our autobiography, what puts together the "what", "when", and "where" of events.
- It is an integration of multimodel information over time.
- As such, the MTL is essential for the rapid acquisition and persistence of such memories.

**Place Cells**
- Neurons that fire at certain physical locations.
- More evidence of embodied, multimodal memory.
- If the path taken matters, more hippocampal input is used (than sensory input), implying that context and episodic memory is required and needs the integrative circuits in the hippocampus.
	- If the journey taken doesn't matter (journey-independent), sensory input is more important.
