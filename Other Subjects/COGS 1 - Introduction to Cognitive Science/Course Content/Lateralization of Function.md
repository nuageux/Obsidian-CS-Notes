## Human Brain
- It’s an extension of the spinal cord.
    - What it evolved to do is to control our bodies and move it to interact with the surrounding environment.
- Cortex
    - 2mm thick and has area of 1.5 sq. meters. Folded to fit into the skull.
- MRI scanning basically “flattens” out our wrinkled brain virtually.
- Cerebral Hemispheres
    - Are pretty similar, but there some different functional differences.
    - Corpus Callosum connects the two hemispheres for communication purposes.
        - Severing this connection allowed research on the different functions of the hemispheres.
    - The neuron cell body is the “grey matter” and the axon (long thing) is the “white matter” (because it has fats to help conduct electrical signals).
- Question is: What is the relationship between brain structure and brain function?
- Gyrus are the hills, sulcus are the valleys
- Cerebral Lobes (4 of them)
    - Frontal Lobe (bordered by the “central sulcus”)
        - Motor control
        - Making decisions, judgments, and emotions
        - Language production
    - Parietal Lobe (also bordered by “central sulcus”)
        - Perception of stimuli related to touch, pressure, temperature, pain (“somatosensation”)
        - Spatial cognition & attention
    - Temporal Lobe (bordered by “Sylvian sulcus/lateral fissure”) (under parietal, behind frontal)
        - Visual perception, object recognition (ex: faces), auditory processing
        - Memory
        - Language comprehension
    - Occipital Lobe (back)
        - Vision and coordinating vision

# Lateralization of Function
- Basically one side of the brain is (slightly) more important and/or efficient for certain tasks.
- Typically a matter of degree (strongly vs. weakly lateralized).
- Mammal motor control is contralateral (a side of the brain controls the opposite side of the body). Strongly Lateralized.
- “Homunculus” representation of amount of brain matter (cortex) dedicated to a body part
    - Sensorimotor Cortex, when stimulated, will also stimulate a certain part of the body.
- Language? Speech is a good example of a strongly lateralized cognitive phenomenon.
    - “Wada Test” looks at language and memory on one side of the brain at a time. Language is controlled by one side of the brain, so this test helps doctors find out which side that is for an individual.
- Research on the topic has been historically done by observing patients with brain damage. → Neuropsychology
    - Paul Broca, neurologist. Studied a man who was unable to communicate through speech. Frontal lobe deemed to be the culprit.
    - “Aphasia”: partial or total loss of ability to articulate ideas due to brain damage → Broca’s Aphasia with “telegraphic speech”, or the opposite “Wernicke’s Aphasia”, where they can speak mostly fine but have trouble understanding.
    - Broca’s Area: lower rear portion of frontal lobe, adjacent to motor cortex
- Korbinian Brodmann studied chemical differences between (52) brain areas.
