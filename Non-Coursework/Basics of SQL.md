#Practical #SQL
# What & Why
SQL is a language for managing **databases**, which take data and generated results based on that data.
- A common type of database is a **relational database**.
	- A row represents an item and a column represents a property of that item.
	- It is easy to *form relations* between tables (generally to avoid unnecessary repetition of information).
- "**Structured Query Language**"
