	- Prevent race conditions
		- Identify *critical sections*, i.e. sections of code that are executed by different processes, which must run *atomically (should not be divided), with respect to each other!*
		- The above (^) enforces mutual exclusion, where only one process is active in a critical section.
	- Wait for resources to become available.
